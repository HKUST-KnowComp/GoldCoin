Analysis:

1. The nurse, acting in her role as the Clinical Nurse Coordinator at CVMC, has access to and control over the patient's medical records and can disclose information as needed for the purposes of providing treatment, payment, and clinic operations.

2. The nurse determines that sharing the patient's blood alcohol level with the police officer is necessary to avert a potential threat to health or safety. She believes that the patient may pose a risk to herself or others if she drives home under the influence.

3. The nurse makes the disclosure to the police officer in the emergency room, who is present due to an agreement between the hospital and the local police department. The purpose of the officer's presence is to provide security and ensure a safe environment within the hospital.

4. The nurse does not obtain the patient's consent before making the disclosure. Instead, she believes that the disclosure is required to protect the patient and others from harm.

5. The police officer arrests the patient based on the information obtained during the interaction. The patient's charges are later dismissed, but the case raises serious questions concerning the legality of the nurse's disclosure of health information without obtaining proper consent.

Compliance Assessment:

In this case, the nurse's disclosure of private health information appears to comply with the regulation. Her decision to disclose the patient's blood alcohol level to the police officer is motivated by a good-faith concern for the patient's health and the safety of the public. The nurse's actions are taken under the reasonable belief that such disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to health or safety."
