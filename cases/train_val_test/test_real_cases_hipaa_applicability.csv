This case revolves around Lilly's defense against claims related to its atypical anti-psychotic drug, Zyprexa. The states, including Connecticut, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, and New Mexico, are seeking damages and reimbursement for Medicaid payments connected to the drug's alleged unlawful marketing.Lilly, aiming to fortify its legal defense, requested access to medical records of Medicaid patients who had been prescribed Zyprexa. Their purpose was clear: to scrutinize the medication's usage patterns and outcomes, and to explore potential confounding factors not apparent in the existing data. This request set off a complex chain of legal debates and privacy concerns.At the heart of this legal tussle were the patients — individuals whose medical histories with Zyprexa were suddenly thrust into the spotlight. Representing a diverse group, these patients had one thing in common: they were beneficiaries of Medicaid, a government-funded healthcare program. Their medical records, detailed and confidential, were held by various state Medicaid agencies, entities bound by privacy laws and ethical obligations.The states, standing firm as guardians of their citizens' private health information, resisted Lilly's demands. They argued that the medical records were not only irrelevant to the case but also protected under physician-patient privilege laws. Furthermore, the states were wary of the burdens and implications of producing such sensitive data.However, the legal framework was more nuanced. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (), particularly sections 45 C.F.R. § 164.512(e)(1)® and 45 C.F.R. § 164.514(b)(2), there were provisions for the disclosure of medical records in legal settings. These regulations permitted the release of medical information for litigation purposes, provided certain criteria and safeguards, like de-identification, were met.Thus, the states found themselves in a legal conundrum. While they sought to protect the privacy of their citizens, they were also bound by federal regulations that allowed certain exceptions, especially in the context of judicial proceedings. The medical records of countless Medicaid patients, once confined to the realm of doctor-patient confidentiality, were now potential evidence in a high-stakes legal dispute over a pharmaceutical drug's impact and marketing practices.","{'Sender': 'State Medicaid Agencies', 'Sender Role': 'Covered Entity under HIPAA', 'Recipient': 'Eli Lilly & Company (Lilly)', 'Recipient Role': 'Defendant in a legal case', 'About': 'Medicaid Patients who used Zyprexa', 'About Role': 'Patients', 'Type': 'Medical Records', 'Purpose': ""For use in litigation to address Lilly's defense in a lawsuit involving the drug Zyprexa"", 'In Reply To': 'Discovery demands in legal proceedings', 'Consented By': 'Consent not explicitly mentioned, but disclosure is under court order', 'Belief': 'None stated explicitly'}",,,,

Understanding this shift, A.S. filed a motion to amend her guardianship status from involuntary to voluntary. The probate court, aiming to assess her capacity, ordered Rutland Mental Health Services, Inc. (RMHS) to evaluate A.S. The purpose was to determine if she understood the nature, extent, and consequences of a voluntary guardianship.RMHS conducted a comprehensive mental health evaluation of A.S. However, the scope of their evaluation extended beyond what was required for a voluntary guardianship assessment. The guardian objected to the evaluation's scope, arguing that it exceeded the necessary boundaries and raised concerns about A.S.’s privacy.The court initially directed RMHS to delete portions of the evaluation that were beyond the required scope and later ordered the sealed return of the evaluation and related notes. The guardian, concerned about A.S.'s privacy and the handling of her sensitive information, filed an appeal.

The encounter between Moss and Dr. Moser formed the basis of a subsequent medical opinion about the nature and cause of Moss's injuries.As the legal case progressed, defense counsel, representing Amira, sought to challenge Moss's claims about the extent and cause of his injuries. In February 2002, a discovery deposition of Dr. Moser was conducted, where he provided professional insights based on his examination and treatment of Moss.In a strategic move, the defense counsel sent a letter to Dr. Moser in April 2003, just before his evidence deposition. This letter contained a detailed narrative of the medical opinions expected to be disclosed at trial, including summaries of opinions from other treating physicians and those that Dr. Moser was expected to give following his discovery deposition. This letter outlined specific views about Moss's medical condition, its causes, and the necessity of surgery, which were crucial to the defense's argument.The letter did not have consent from Moss, the patient, and was part of a legal strategy to bolster the defense's case. The defense counsel believed this approach was necessary for case preparation and did not see it as a violation of any legal or ethical standards.

They presented the grim prognosis and the unlikely chance of Ella regaining consciousness or cognitive functions. After careful consideration and with heavy hearts, Ella's parents consented to withdraw life support, a decision made more challenging by their deep concern for Ella's well-being and quality of life.The decision to withdraw life support, including hydration and nutrition, was based on a consensus among the medical professionals and the concurrence of Ella's parents, who were fully informed and involved in this heart-wrenching decision.

This program required Sanchez to undergo a comprehensive evaluation, which included analyses of his psychological state, social and educational history, and details of the offense. The results of this SSODA evaluation were crucial in shaping his path forward: two years of probation under strict supervision in a treatment center.As part of its duty to assess and manage the risks posed by sex offenders, the King County Sheriff’s Office sought access to Sanchez’s SSODA evaluation.

These records were essential for her treatment for a lumbar sprain and other related medical services.As the case evolved into a proposed class action suit, Hart sought to compel the defendant to produce documents, including all of the company's Personal Injury Protection (PIP) files and other related communications, from a span of several years. These files contained sensitive Personal Health Information (PHI) and personal financial information of potentially hundreds of policyholders, many of whom were unaware of the ongoing litigation and their potential membership in the class action.The defendant, on the other hand, raised concerns about the broad scope of the discovery requests, particularly highlighting the need to protect the privacy of non-party information under laws like the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (), specifically citing 45 CFR § 164.530(c)(2) for safeguarding PHI. They proposed the production of data compilations as a less intrusive alternative to individual PIP files, arguing that the plaintiff's requests were not only overbroad but also jeopardized the privacy of individuals not directly involved in the lawsuit.In this complex legal landscape, both parties navigated the delicate balance between the necessity of disclosure for the purposes of litigation and the legal obligations to protect the privacy of individuals' health information. The court was tasked with determining the extent to which such information could be shared without violating privacy laws, setting a precedent for how sensitive information is handled in the context of legal discovery.","{'Sender': 'Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company', 'Sender Role': 'Defendant', 'Recipient': 'Geneyne Hart (Plaintiff) and potentially the Court', 'Recipient Role': 'Plaintiff (and possibly the Court)', 'About': 'Potential class members and Geneyne Hart', 'About Role': 'Insurance policyholders and claimants', 'Type': 'Personal Health Information (PHI), including medical records and personal financial information', 'Purpose': 'Legal discovery and potential evidence in a class action lawsuit', 'In Reply To': 'Requests for Production of Documents in the context of litigation', 'Consented By': 'None specified explicitly in the case details', 'Belief': 'Defendant believes it is required to protect this information under privacy laws but is being compelled to disclose due to legal discovery processes.'}",,,,

This disability stemmed from a condition that required Morris to undergo brain surgery years before his employment, resulting in him having to take methadone to prevent headaches and fluid build-up. Despite presenting his prescription medication to the management, Morris was sent home until clearance from the company's doctors, which never came, ultimately leading to his termination about seven months later.As part of the legal proceedings, the defendant’s legal counsel issued subpoenas to various non-party entities, including hospitals, doctors, and employment and unemployment agencies, seeking Morris's medical records, employment records, unemployment compensation records, and Social Security application. These subpoenas were sent to collect evidence to defend against Morris's claims and possibly to prove the legitimacy of his termination, focusing on whether it was truly based on a perceived disability or other valid reasons.The legal teams involved have leveraged these subpoenas as part of their strategy to gather relevant information, with the defendant aiming to compile a comprehensive view of Morris's medical history, employment history, and financial benefits received post-termination. This action sparked a legal debate over the appropriateness and scope of the subpoenas, leading to motions to quash and compel by the plaintiff and defendant, respectively.This narrative outlines the complex interplay between legal rights, privacy concerns, and the pursuit of justice within the framework of employment law and disability discrimination.

The child's grieving mother, seeking justice and answers, initiated a wrongful death action against Union Pacific, aiming to prove that the company was liable for the incident.As the lawsuit progressed, the plaintiff sought to uncover every piece of evidence that could support her claim, leading her to request the medical files of the three train crew members involved in the tragic event.

These files were held by Union Pacific and maintained in the ordinary course of the company’s business, overseen by the chief medical officer or surgeon.However, this request sparked a significant legal debate over the privacy of the employees' medical information. Union Pacific objected to the request, citing concerns over violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act () and other medical privacy laws. They argued that the request was overly broad, unduly burdensome, and sought private and confidential information that was irrelevant to the case at hand.The dispute over these medical files reached the courtroom, where arguments were made about the balance between the need for discovery in legal proceedings and the protection of individual privacy rights.

This action, rooted in a desire for self-advocacy and perhaps a deeper understanding of his medical treatment and status, was met with resistance. The hospital’s privacy officer, standing as the gatekeeper to Merryfield's personal health information, denied the request. This decision was further affirmed by the hospital’s medical director in November of the same year, citing the rationale that Merryfield's records were not eligible for disclosure due to their compilation in anticipation of, or for use in, legal proceedings. This justification, purportedly rooted in 's protections against unwarranted disclosures, effectively barred Merryfield from accessing his own health information.Feeling aggrieved by this denial, Merryfield escalated the matter by filing a habeas corpus petition in December 2009, alongside a motion requesting the appointment of counsel.

PHI includes a wide array of data, from medical bills to claim documents, inherently personal and confidential.To comply with the stringent privacy restrictions mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (), particularly the requirement to safeguard PHI disclosed to third parties, Monarch and Freedom executed a Business Associate Agreement (BAA). This contract was pivotal, underscoring the mutual understanding and commitment to protect the privacy of the plan members’ health information.Karen Indellicati, representing Freedom, spearheaded the audit, which culminated in two key documents: a Public Audit Report containing aggregated data devoid of unique identifiers, ensuring anonymity, and a Privileged Supplement that included individual medical claims and records, thus containing PHI. Despite the safeguards established by the BAA, the subsequent unauthorized disclosure of the Privileged Supplement's contents to third parties led to a complex legal dispute, highlighting the critical importance of vigilance and adherence to privacy laws in the handling of PHI.","{'Sender': 'Monarch Fire Protection District', 'Sender Role': 'Employer/Self-funded health plan provider', 'Recipient': 'Freedom Consulting & Auditing Services, Inc.

Their mission was noble: to unearth any instances of abuse and neglect, educate both staff and patients on the sacrosanct rights of patients, and ensure that the hospitals remained true to their commitment to uphold these rights.The historical practice allowed these advocates unrestricted access to the electronic bastions of patient health information. This access wasn’t for naught; it was the bedrock upon which they could perform comprehensive audits, leading to actionable insights aimed at refining patient care and safeguarding civil liberties within the walls of these institutions.However, the serene flow of information hit a snag in June 2014. The DHHR, citing concerns perhaps more aligned with protocol than patient well-being, instituted a new policy. This policy demanded that patient advocates secure signed releases from patients or their legal representatives before peeking into any health records. Even more, each inquiry into a patient’s records necessitated a fresh release, effectively barricading the advocates from the information that was once readily available to them.This abrupt policy shift wasn’t just a logistical nightmare; it struck at the very heart of patient advocacy. The advocates were no longer just voices for the voiceless; they were now outsiders, hamstrung by bureaucratic tape, unable to perform the systemic audits that had been their bread and butter.The DHHR’s stance was clear: patient privacy was paramount, a shield against any potential misuse of sensitive health information.

The Buckmans argued that these records were necessary to assess Dr. Verazin's surgical experience and technique, which they alleged was negligent.Dr. Verazin, along with Wyoming Valley Health System, Inc., and Wilkes-Barre General Hospital, objected to this request. They argued that the information sought was protected health information and that disclosing it, even in a redacted form that concealed patient names and medical record numbers, would violate the patients' privacy rights. The objection was grounded in the belief that such disclosure could potentially breach confidentiality obligations under federal and state laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ().Despite these concerns, the court initially ruled in favor of the Buckmans, ordering the appellants to produce the requested documents, albeit redacted to remove identifiers. This decision was based on the premise that the operative notes, once redacted, would not violate patient privacy while serving a critical role in the ongoing litigation. The court's order emphasized that the disclosure was aligned with legal protocols for handling protected health information in judicial settings, specifically referring to the  regulation 45 C.F.R. § 164.512(a), which allows for such disclosures under certain conditions.This case thus revolves around the complex interplay between the need for information in legal proceedings and the imperative to protect patient privacy.

The collision was severe enough to leave Kirsch unconscious, prompting a 911 call from the scene.Emergency responders quickly arrived, extricated Kirsch from the wrecked vehicle, and rushed him to Ben Taub Hospital. Upon arrival, although Kirsch was conscious, he was uncooperative, refusing to speak or follow commands consistently. This behavior raised suspicions of intoxication among the medical staff, despite the lack of alcohol odor on his breath. Dr. Becker, the emergency center chief, decided to conduct a blood-alcohol test among other diagnostic procedures to assess Kirsch's condition accurately. The test results showed a blood-alcohol level of 0.10, above the legal limit, indicating that Kirsch had been driving while intoxicated.Without Kirsch's consent and without a direct request from law enforcement, hospital personnel disclosed the blood-alcohol test results to the Houston deputies who had arrived at the hospital to check on their fellow deputy. This action was taken under the belief that it was necessary to inform law enforcement about a potential crime — driving while intoxicated — that had occurred.In the meantime, the investigation into the accident continued, with officers retrieving data from the car's black box to reconstruct the events leading up to the crash.

The recipient of this call was the 911 Dispatch Service, a crucial emergency service provider trained to respond to such calls with promptness and efficiency.The heart of this story lies in the interaction between the caller and the 911 dispatch. The caller, driven by the urgency of the medical emergency, implicitly consented to share protected health information (PHI) with the dispatch service. This information included details that could identify the nature of the emergency, symptoms, and potentially even the identity of the individual in distress. The purpose was clear: to secure immediate medical attention for the caller or someone else at the scene requiring emergency assistance.This exchange, rooted in the belief that sharing PHI was essential for effective emergency response, highlights the complex interplay of consent, privacy, and the need for information in critical health-related situations. The 911 dispatch, acting as the first point of contact in the emergency medical services chain, collected the PHI as part of their role in facilitating timely and appropriate emergency response.

Kalinosky, the plaintiff, initiated a lawsuit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, claiming that the defendant's actions had caused her severe emotional distress. As a result, she sought the services of a mental health professional, Mary Jean Kane, a licensed social worker, for treatment related to her mental health, emotional conditions, and any associated physical symptoms. The legal battle escalated when the defendant served a subpoena on Kane, demanding the release of all medical records related to Kalinosky's treatment without limitation, encompassing a wide array of documents from progress notes to billing information.Responding to the subpoena, Kane faced a dilemma, balancing legal obligations with the privacy protections afforded by  and the common law psychotherapy privilege. The situation was further complicated by the fact that Kalinosky had placed her mental health at the center of her legal claims, effectively waiving certain privacy protections by alleging that her emotional distress was a direct consequence of the defendant's actions.To navigate this complex landscape, Kane examined the specifics of  regulations, particularly focusing on the requirements for disclosing psychotherapy notes. Under normal circumstances, such notes are fiercely protected to maintain the confidentiality of the therapeutic relationship. However, Kalinosky had provided explicit authorization for the release of her medical information, including psychotherapy notes, to be used in the lawsuit. This authorization, coupled with the fact that the lawsuit necessitated the disclosure of these records, positioned Kane in a challenging spot.Despite Kane's reservations and her interpretation of  regulations and District of Columbia law—which provides even stricter protections for mental health information—the court had to consider the federal legal framework governing the case.

Methadone maintenance therapy, recognized for its efficacy in treating heroin dependence, represented a crucial lifeline for many individuals struggling with addiction, a condition that significantly impairs one's ability to lead a normal life, encompassing difficulties in employability, parenting, and everyday functioning.The initiative by A Helping Hand was met with resistance from local authorities. Despite securing a lease for a site previously utilized as a medical clinic and engaging in promising discussions with state officials, the organization encountered a complex web of bureaucratic challenges. The local zoning laws and the permitting process became formidable barriers, with the submission of site plans and a protracted review process delaying the clinic's opening.The situation took a dramatic turn when, mere hours after the issuance of a permit, the County Council enacted legislation imposing new zoning requirements that the clinic's site failed to meet. This legislative move, coupled with subsequent fines and legal challenges, underscored a contentious battle over the clinic's establishment, raising questions about discrimination and the rights of individuals with disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).Amidst this legal and regulatory maelstrom, the privacy of the clinic's patients emerged as a focal point of concern. The defendants' quest for discovery sought to pierce the veil of confidentiality surrounding medical information, prompting A Helping Hand to seek a protective order. The organization argued that revealing sensitive patient data would not only violate privacy rights but also exacerbate the stigma and challenges faced by recovering addicts. This contention brought to the fore the delicate balance between the need for information in legal disputes and the imperative to protect individual privacy, especially in matters as sensitive as health and recovery from addiction.The backdrop of this legal battle, set against the broader societal struggle with heroin addiction, highlights the critical role of privacy protections in healthcare.

The information sought was specific: claim number, full name of the claimant, full name of the attorney, date of the alleged tort, date of tort claim notice, and whether the claim was open or closed.OHSU, the guardian of the requested data, found itself at a crossroads. The information pertained to a variety of claimants, including patients and employees, who had, for different reasons, filed tort claims against the institution. These claims spanned across various categories, such as professional liability and employment liability, involving both faculty and non-faculty members, as well as students.In response to The Oregonian's request, OHSU compiled a document. This document was meant to navigate the complex waters of legal and privacy concerns. It aimed to disclose the information that did not infringe upon the privacy rights of the individuals involved. However, OHSU decided to withhold certain pieces of information, such as the names of the claimants and some dates of the alleged torts, citing privacy laws and regulations. This decision was rooted in a belief that releasing such information would not only violate the privacy rights of the individuals but also potentially breach regulations designed to protect such information.The Oregonian, driven by a commitment to transparency and public knowledge, did not accept this partial disclosure. They argued that the information they sought did not infringe on privacy rights, especially since they did not request any information generated in the course of medical treatment. This dispute underscored the tension between public interest in transparency and the individual's right to privacy.This background sets the stage for a legal confrontation that would explore the boundaries of privacy in public records and the responsibilities of public institutions in safeguarding or disclosing information. It was a story not just about the flow of private information, but also about the interpretation of laws and regulations governing that flow in the context of public interest and individual privacy rights.","{'Sender': 'Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)', 'Sender Role': 'Public Health Institution', 'Recipient': 'Oregonian Publishing Company, LLC (The Oregonian)', 'Recipient Role': 'Media Company', 'About': 'Claimants of tort claims', 'About Role': 'Patients or Employees', 'Type': 'Name of the claimant, date of the alleged tort, name of claimant’s attorney', 'Purpose': 'Compliance with a public records request', 'In Reply To': 'Request from The Oregonian for information on tort claims', 'Consented By': 'Not explicitly mentioned', 'Belief': 'OHSU believed that disclosing certain information would violate privacy laws or regulations'}",,,,

The session, led by employee Robert Griffith, involved an exercise that resulted in Simon falling into gym equipment, causing her injuries and subsequent complications. Seeking justice and compensation for her ordeal, Simon and her legal representation sought to uncover the identities of any eyewitnesses to the fall through legal discovery processes. This information was crucial for building a solid case against the Wellness Center, highlighting the negligence that led to the accident.The legal team sent out the first set of interrogatories and requests for production of documents to the Wellness Center, explicitly asking for the names, telephone numbers, and addresses of anyone who might have witnessed the incident. This action was a direct response to their initial discovery request, aimed at collecting evidence for the ongoing litigation. However, Specialty Orthopaedics, P.C., initially resisted these requests, citing  regulations to argue that releasing such information would violate privacy laws. They contended that the requested data constituted protected health information, shielded under ’s privacy provisions.Despite this objection, the legal system's mechanisms continued to turn, with the court granting motions to compel the defendant to comply with the discovery requests.

Vernon Peltz, while driving his pickup truck, lost control, resulting in the vehicle crossing the center line, navigating through opposing traffic, and eventually crashing into a roadside sign. This accident prompted an immediate response from the Arizona Department of Public Safety, including Trooper Saleem Abdullah.Upon arrival, Trooper Abdullah observed significant evidence of the crash, including blood within the driver's area of the vehicle, indicative of injuries sustained by the occupants. Vernon Peltz and his mother, J.K., were found in a state of distress, with Peltz displaying visible injuries and signs of intoxication, including a cut above his eye and blood on his hands, alongside his red, watery eyes and a flushed face.In the aftermath, medical technicians swiftly transported Peltz and his mother to nearby hospitals for urgent care. Trooper Abdullah, keen on gathering evidence pertinent to the accident, followed Peltz to the hospital. It was here that a pivotal moment occurred; a nurse informed Abdullah that a blood sample would be drawn from Peltz for medical purposes. Seizing the opportunity, Abdullah requested a portion of this sample to determine Peltz's blood alcohol content (BAC), a critical piece of evidence for the investigation.As Abdullah waited in a common area of the hospital, near the nurses' station and outside Peltz's room, he overheard Peltz engaging in a phone conversation. Peltz candidly admitted to having consumed ""a few alcoholic drinks"" before driving. This overheard admission, coupled with the subsequent BAC results showing a level of .142, significantly bolstered the case against Peltz, leading to charges of aggravated assault and DUI.This scenario underscores the complex interplay between healthcare providers' roles, law enforcement duties, and the paramount importance of patient privacy. Despite the urgency and law enforcement's investigatory needs, the flow of private health information, such as BAC levels, demands careful navigation of  regulations, emphasizing the need for explicit consent and the safeguarding of patient rights amidst legal proceedings.","{'Sender': 'Nurse at the hospital', 'Sender Role': 'Healthcare provider', 'Recipient': 'Trooper Saleem Abdullah', 'Recipient Role': 'Law enforcement officer', 'About': 'Vernon Peltz', 'About Role': 'Patient', 'Type': 'Blood alcohol content (BAC) level', 'Purpose': 'Law enforcement investigation', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'Not explicitly mentioned, but implied consent by Vernon Peltz due to the circumstances', 'Belief': 'The officer believed that obtaining the BAC was necessary for the investigation of the DUI and assault charges.'}",,,,

['164.512(a)'],Permit,"In the healthcare and legal industries, the protection of patient information is paramount, governed by stringent laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (). This case unfolds around the legal tussle between Northwest, a healthcare entity, and Washington Regional Medical Center (WRMC), another key player in the healthcare sector, entangled over the conduct of Dr. Shaun Senter, a physician whose professional actions sparked the litigation.Dr. Senter, once affiliated with Northwest, had moved on to WRMC, his transition marked by a legal pursuit from his previous employer. Northwest, aiming to strengthen its case, issued a subpoena duces tecum to WRMC. This legal demand was not ordinary; it sought detailed information about every patient Dr. Senter had seen or treated since his tenure began at WRMC up until a specified date. The request was comprehensive, asking for patient names (which could be anonymized), dates of service, and the nature of medical services rendered by Dr. Senter. The purpose was clear: to underpin Northwest's legal strategy with concrete data on Dr. Senter's professional engagements post his departure from Northwest.WRMC, faced with this subpoena, was thrust into a complex situation. Protecting patient privacy is a fundamental responsibility for healthcare providers, enshrined in  regulations. WRMC objected to the subpoena on several grounds, including the protection of health information under  and the potential breach of patient confidentiality, despite the absence of direct patient consent for such a disclosure. The tension between legal obligations and patient privacy rights was palpable.The case escalated to a judicial level, where arguments were heard, and the court's wisdom sought. The legal proceedings scrutinized the balance between the necessity of information for litigation and the inviolable right to patient privacy. In an intriguing turn, the court found a path through the legal thicket, directing WRMC to provide the requested information with a crucial modification: patient names were to be replaced with generic numbers, ensuring anonymity yet complying with the subpoena.This decision was not reached lightly but was underpinned by a protective order aimed at safeguarding the disclosed information. The case, thus, navigates through the intricate dance of legal rights, professional obligations, and the sacrosanct principle of patient privacy, highlighting the challenges and responsibilities healthcare providers face in the legal arena.","{'Sender': 'WRMC (Washington Regional Medical Center)', 'Sender Role': 'Health Care Provider', 'Recipient': 'Northwest', 'Recipient Role': 'Legal Entity/Competitor', 'About': 'Patients treated or consulted by Dr. Shaun Senter', 'About Role': 'Patients', 'Type': 'Names (replaced by generic numbers for anonymity), dates of medical services, types of medical services performed', 'Purpose': 'Legal Discovery in Litigation', 'In Reply To': 'Subpoena duces tecum issued by Northwest', 'Consented By': 'None (information was to be disclosed under a court order without explicit patient consent)', 'Belief': ""The information is essential for Northwest's legal action against Dr. Senter; believed disclosure under protective order would not violate patient privacy rights""}",,,,

[],Not Applicable,"We accept as true all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint. Reger Dev., LLC v. Nat’l City Bank, 592 F.3d 759, 763 (7th Cir.2010). In August 2010, Senne violated the Village’s overnight parking ban and was issued parking citation number P2794846. The fine was $20. The citation was printed electronically and placed underneath one of the windshield-wipers on his vehicle. Senne discovered it approximately five hours after it was placed on the vehicle. The citation included personal information about Senne — his name, address, driver’s license number, date of birth, sex, height, and weight. The information came from motor vehicle records maintained by the Illinois Secretary of State. The directions on the citation stated that the recipient could pay the fine in person or request a hearing. The citation also doubled as an envelope, and the directions said to use it if paying by mail. The complaint does not say if Senne followed those directions, but because personal information appeared on the outside of the citation-turned-envelope, anyone who came across it could have viewed his personal information. Thus, under the Village’s practice, personal information gets disclosed once when the ticket is placed on the vehicle, and then a second time if the recipient pays by mail. That is Senne’s position, in any event.The DPPA provides a cause of action against persons and certain entities who disclose “personal information ... from a motor vehicle record, for a purpose not permitted under” the DPPA. 18 U.S.C. § 2724(a). After Senne received his citation, he filed suit on behalf of himself and other similarly situated individuals. His complaint alleges that the Village, through its officers, violates the DPPA by placing personal information on traffic citations.The Village filed a motion to dismiss the case, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Village argued that placing a traffic ticket on a windshield does not “disclose” personal information within the contemplation of the DPPA. The Village also argued that, even if it did disclose Senne’s personal information, placing a traffic ticket on a vehicle is a “permissible use” under 18 U.S.C. § 2721(b). The district court granted the Village’s motion to dismiss on both grounds, providing a short statement of reasons in open court.

Defendants DiMaggio and Lucio were allegedly involved in drug trafficking activity via Federal Express in which every seven to ten days defendants would send packages of money to two individuals in Orlando, Florida, Reggie Aurrichio and Gary Hammond, who would then mail Federal Express packages containing cocaine to defendants in Rome and Utica, New York. It is undisputed that the packages of money claimed to have been sent by defendants were never addressed by name to the two Orlando individuals but rather were mailed to their known residences under fictitious personal or business names. Significantly, defendants’ names and addresses never appeared on these packages as the senders. Similarly, the addressees of the packages of cocaine allegedly intended for delivery to defendants in Rome and Utica were fictitious individuals and addressed to locations other than defendants’ actual places of residence.

The .car contained two males, the driver and the front passenger, and appellant, who was seated behind the driver. After the driver parked the Volvo (apparently without prompting by the police), the officers pulled up, turned on their emergency lights, and approached the car on foot. The officer who approached from the passenger side saw a large semiautomatic handgun on the floor below the front passenger’s legs, and saw the front passenger move his legs in an attempt to conceal the weapon. The officers then ordered all three occupants to get out and placed them in handcuffs.After confirming that the vehicle had been reported stolen and contained a handgun, the officers arrested all the oceu-pants. At that point, appellant spontaneously asked, “[W]hat’s going to happen to my purse?” and “Is it going to be at the station[?]” The officers then searched the car for weapons, ammunition, and contraband related to the handgun. They found a purse, large enough to hold a handgun, on the rear seat. Another officer searched the purse and, within “just a few seconds,” found a plastic bag containing marijuana inside it.Prior to trial, Ms. Johnson moved to suppress the marijuana, arguing that the police lacked reason to believe (either probable cause or reasonable, articulable suspicion) that she was involved in criminal activity and therefore had no right to search the purse.

Applying Arizona v. Gant, - U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009), Judge Epstein concluded that the police had authority to search the passenger compartment and those containers within it capable of holding evidence of the crime, including weapons and ammunition.

Because no rule or statute precludes such intervention, and, in fact, Delaware courts have generally allowed it, this Court granted the motion to intervene and the motion to expedite the proceedings. See Gannett Co., Inc. v. State, Del.Supr., 565 A.2d 895, 899 (1989) (“Gannett I”); Van Arsdall v. State, Del.Supr., 486 A.2d 1 (1984); State v. Shipley, Del.Super., 497 A2d 1052 (1985). The State filed its memorandum opposing the motion to unseal on October 23, 1997. On October 24, 1997, the Court heard oral argument on the motion to unseal. The issues are now ripe for decision.II. ISSUESThe News Journal argues first that it has a “presumed right of access” to pre-indictment search warrants and supporting documentation under both the First Amendment and the common law and that the result of the analysis is the same under either standard. (Intervenor’s Memorandum at 10, hereafter referred to as “Int. Mem. at page no.”). The State responds that every court that has addressed this issue has denied the press access to sealed pre-indictment search warrant documentation. (State’s Memorandum at 1, hereafter referred to as “St. Mem. at page no.”).Second, the News Journal contends that even if the Court finds no First Amendment or common law right of access to the search warrant documentation, the Court should excise sensitive portions of the documentation and release a redacted version. (Int. Mem. at 6.)Finally, the News Journal argues that before a court may issue an order depriving the public of its First Amendment rights, the court must give notice of the proposed order and allow interested parties to be heard so that they may challenge the order. (Int. Mem. at 7.) The Court addresses these issues seriatim.I","{'Sender': 'The News Journal Company', 'Sender Role': 'Press', 'Recipient': 'Court', 'Recipient Role': 'Legal Authority', 'About': 'Louis Riccio', 'About Role': 'Victim', 'Type': 'Pre-indictment search warrants and supporting documentation', 'Purpose': 'Access to information', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'None'}",,,[],Not Applicable

Shortly after midnight on the evening of November 18, 1992, Ms. Kelly was driving her rental car back to her hotel in Metairie after having celebrated her birthday with some friends. Ms. Kelly made an illegal left turn, and was stopped by a New Orleans Police Officer, who asked to see her driver’s license. Ms. Kelly did not have her license with her, informing the officer that she had forgotten it in her hotel room. The officer administered a “DWI” test on Ms. Kelly, which she passed. Nevertheless, the officer placed her under arrest for the traffic violations and had her transported to Central Lock-Up in Orleans Parish. The arresting officer did not search Ms. Kelly or the car, nor did he ask for the vehicle registration.At Central Lock-Up, Ms. Kelly turned over a tote bag which she had been carrying containing her wallet, check book, various credit cards, her airline ticket, her address book and other personal items, and was placed in a holding cell. Before being placed in a second holding cell, Ms. Kelly was pat-down searched. The deputy who. searched her did not notice the asthma inhaler and American Express card which she had forgotten in her pockets. While at Central Lock-Up, Ms. Kelly was allowed to use a telephone, and contacted her husband in Connecticut and a sister living in Baton Rouge.After being placed in a third holding cell, Ms. Kelly was shackled and handcuffed and transferred to the female detention facility. Upon arriving at the detention facility, Ms. Kelly was escorted to a room where a female deputy strip-searched her. The deputy ordered Ms. Kelly to remove her clothes and then to turn around, bend over, spread her buttocks and cough, so that the deputy could visually inspect Ms. Kelly’s vaginal and rectal cavities.Ms. Kelly put her clothes back on, and was escorted to another room, where she and another arrestee were ordered to undress. Ms. Kelly was then sprayed with disinfectant on her crotch, breasts and head.After showering, Ms. Kelly placed her street clothes in a bag and received a prison uniform, but she forgot to hold on to her asthma inhaler. Ms. Kelly was placed in a cell at approximately 5:00 a.m. She made repeated requests for her inhaler. At approximately 10:30 a.m., a corpsman provided her with a different inhaler.At approximately 11:30 a.m., Ms. Kelly was notified that she was bonded out. Ms. Kelly’s incarceration lasted approximately fourteen hours.Ms. Kelly has brought a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim against the defendants for deprivation of her federal constitutional rights and has also alleged a number of supplemental state causes of action. Defendant Sheriff Charles C. Foti, Jr. (“Sheriff Foti”) has moved for summary judgment on all of the plaintiffs claims.

In November of 1991, Reeve called the Des Moines Police Department and complained of barking dogs in her neighborhood. Stephen A. Oliver, an animal control officer, responded to the call. Shortly after arriving at Reeve’s residence, Oliver “intentionally began touching and rubbing [Reeve’s] back and starring [sic] at [Reeve’s] chest.” After Reeve moved away from Oliver, Oliver left to investigate the problem dogs. Oliver returned to Reeve’s residence a short time later with information concerning the dogs and “again intentionally touched and rubbed [Reeve’s] back.” When Reeve again moved away from Oliver, Oliver left the residence without further incident.Reeve’s complaint raises three claims based on these facts. In Count I, Reeve alleges that Oliver’s actions deprived her of “liberty and privacy interests and equal protection rights in being free from sexual harassment by a State actor.” In Count II, she alleges that Police Chief William Moulder and the City of Des Moines are vicariously liable for Oliver’s acts and were negligent in supervising Oliver. In Count III, she alleges that Oliver committed an assault and a battery.In response to the complaint, Oliver filed a motion to dismiss and Moulder and the City of Des Moines filed a motion for summary judgment. The district court determined that Reeve had failed to plead “facts demonstrating a deprivation of established constitutional rights.... ” On this basis, the court held that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the constitutional claim and could not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.

[],Not Applicable,"A Metropolitan Police officer executing a search warrant opened the screen door and knocked on the wooden door of the premises to be searched. Apparently the inner door was not latched properly for it swung open when the officer knocked, although his knock was not' unusually forceful. Through the open door the officer saw the defendant and two others sitting on a sofa in the living room, watching television. The officer announced his presence and purpose to execute a search warrant while standing at the threshold and then without further delay entered the apartment.After securing the individuals in the living room, the officer and his colleagues searched the apartment, recovering a handgun, ammunition, drug paraphernalia, cocaine residue, and an electric scale. The defendant was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of federal law, and possession of an unregistered pistol and unregistered ammunition, in violation of District of Columbia law.The defendant moved to suppress the evidence that had been seized in the -search, alleging a violation of the federal knock and announce statute. It provides that an “officer may break open any outer or inner door or window of a house ... to execute a search warrant, if, after notice of his authority and purpose, he is refused admittance.... ” 18 U.S.C. § 3109. As we have interpreted this statute, notice and refusal are preconditions of a lawful “breaking” by the police, absent exigent circumstances.At the suppression hearing the police officer testified that he believed that the individuals in the house might be armed and that his and the other officers’ fives were in danger. Relying upon Keiningham v. United States, 287 F.2d 126, 130 (D.C.Cir.1960), the district court held that, because he entered without permission, the officer’s entry into the apartment was a “breaking” and a “technical violation of the statute.” The court then found that there was no such exigency as would excuse a departure from the requirements of the statute, and therefore granted the defendant’s motion to suppress physical evidence. ■ The Government appeals that ruling.'","{'Sender': 'Metropolitan Police officer', 'Sender Role': 'Law enforcement', 'Recipient': 'None', 'Recipient Role': 'None', 'About': 'Defendant', 'About Role': 'None', 'Type': 'Private information including possession of firearm, ammunition, drug paraphernalia, cocaine residue, and an electric scale', 'Purpose': 'None', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'None'}",,,[],Not Applicable
[],Not Applicable,"On November 20, 2004, Belleville, Illinois police officers Michael Pearce and Timothy Lay stopped McDonald’s car after they received an anonymous tip and believed McDonald fit the description. As Officer Pearce approached McDonald, he noticed a gun on the floor of the car. Because McDonald had previously been convicted of a felony, he was charged under § 922(g)(1) for being a felon in possession of a firearm. McDonald moved to suppress evidence pertaining to the gun, initially arguing that the officers should not have pulled him over because the anonymous tip alone was not sufficient evidence to provide probable cause to stop him. The government responded, however, that McDonald was actually stopped because he used his turn signal but never turned onto a different street. The officers believed that was a traffic offense under 625 111. Comp. Stat. 5/ll-804(d) (2005). McDonald responded that § 5/11— 804 did not prohibit his actions and that Officer Pearce’s mistake of law could not justify a traffic stop.Officer Pearce testified at the hearing on the motion, stating that the police received a tip claiming that a black male driving a maroon Buick possessed drugs and a handgun. Later that night, the officers saw a car matching that description and began to follow it. When the driver flashed his turn signal at a ninety-degree curve in the road where the road changed names, Officer Pearce stopped the car. He testified that he consulted his “Offense Code Book” (a guide for police officers that catalogs traffic laws), which listed an offense for “Improper use of turn signal” — the book contained a citation to § ll-804(d) but provided neither the statutory language nor any further description of the offense. Officer Pearce concluded that McDonald did not need to use his turn signal at the bend in the road and that he must have improperly used the signal.The district court ruled that the anonymous tip would probably not have been a sufficient ground to stop McDonald, but that the stop was warranted because Officer Pearce reasonably believed McDonald’s use of the turn signal was a violation of state law. The district court also stated in a footnote that although the statute does not specifically proscribe McDonald’s use of the turn signal, “it could, arguably, be so interpreted.” The court denied the motion to suppress. McDonald then pled guilty, but reserved his right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion.","{'Sender': 'Anonymous tip', 'Sender Role': 'None', 'Recipient': 'Belleville, Illinois police officers', 'Recipient Role': 'Law enforcement', 'About': 'McDonald', 'About Role': 'None', 'Type': 'Criminal activity', 'Purpose': 'Law enforcement investigation', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'McDonald had drugs and a handgun in his possession.'}",,,[],Not Applicable

Officer Briseno then advised Officer Postlewait to arrest Defendant. After he arrested Defendant, Officer Postlewait retrieved the plastic baggie, which contained methamphetamine, from inside the vehicle.{4} Defendant moved to suppress the methamphetamine.

That order designated May 9, 2002 as the deadline for all motions for the joinder of parties and the amendment of pleadings. Paper no. 8.Plaintiff filed a motion seeking leave to amend her complaint on August 7, 2002. Plaintiff attached the proposed amended complaint to the motion but did not submit a memorandum. In the text of the motion, Plaintiff noted that she had sought and was denied Defendant’s consent to amend the complaint and now requested leave of court to amend because: “(1) Evidence has surfaced regarding the factual allegations of the complaint; (2) Plaintiff would like to join a party to the complaint; and (3) In view of the evidence, plaintiff would now like to plead her complaint in separate counts.” Paper no. 14.

Plaintiff filed her motion on August 7, 2002. Plaintiffs motion to amend her complaint after the deadline triggers both Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) governing amendments to pleadings and Fed. R.Civ.P. 16(b) governing modification to a scheduling order. The standards for satisfying the rules are at odds. Rule 15(a) states, in pertinent part, that “... leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.” According to Rule 16(b) however, “[a] schedule shall not be modified except upon a showing of good cause and by leave of the district judge....”Neither the Fourth Circuit nor the Supreme Court has dealt decisively with the interplay of these two rules when a motion to amend is made after the deadline set in the scheduling order has passed. However, one district court in the Fourth Circuit set up a “two step” analysis:Once the scheduling order’s deadline for amendment of the pleadings has passed, a moving party first must satisfy the good cause standard of Rule 16(b). If the moving party satisfies Rule 16(b), the movant then must pass the tests for amendment under 15(a).Marcum v. Zimmer, 163 F.R.D. 250, 254 (S.D.W.Va.1995); see also Johnson v.

[],Not Applicable,"In 1991, as her term as a Member of the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB” or “Board”) was about to expire, Mary Miller Cracraft sent letters and faxes to a number of individuals in an attempt to secure her reappointment. Cracraft continued this correspondence until August, when she failed to be renominated to the Board. In November, Gallant, Vice-President of the National Right to Work Committee, filed a request with the NLRB under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552 (1988), seeking all documents “pertaining to efforts to secure or support the renomination of Mary Cra-craft to the Board” or “reflecting the use of Board facilities, equipment or vehicles in efforts to secure or support the renomination of Mary Cracraft.”The NLRB initially rejected Gallant’s request, stating that the documents in question were either Cracraft’s “personal records” (rather than “agency records” for purposes of the FOIA) or were exempted from disclosure on privacy grounds under FOIA Exemption 6, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6). When Gallant appealed, the Board released two letters written by NLRB Chairman James Stephens to individuals in the Office of the President, urging Cracraft’s renomination to prevent any slowdown in the NLRB’s case processing. The Board also released a copy of the NLRB’s fax log, which recorded a total of 33 faxes sent by Cracraft relating to her renomination efforts. The names of the fax recipients were redacted from the logs on privacy grounds under FOIA Exemption 6.On April 10, 1992, Gallant filed a FOIA action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. On June 19, Gallant moved for production of a Vaughn Index. On July 1, the district court denied the motion. The government then moved for summary judgment on July 10, 1992. After considering the parties’ pleadings and affidavits from NLRB Chairman Stephens, Cra-craft, Diane Byrd (Stephens’s confidential assistant), and Mildred Corthon (Cracraft’s confidential secretary), the district court ruled in favor of the Board.The court first ruled that Cracraft’s correspondence relating to her renomination constituted personal rather than “agency records” under the test set out in Tax Analysts v. United States Dep’t of Justice, 845 F.2d 1060, 1069 (D.C.Cir.1988), aff'd, 492 U.S. 136, 109 S.Ct. 2841, 106 L.Ed.2d 112 (1989). The court then concluded that the names of the fax recipients were properly redacted from the fax logs under FOIA Exemption 6, since release of the names implicated significant privacy interests and Gallant , had failed to allege a public interest which outweighed those interests. Gallant challenges both of these rulings on appeal, arguing that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for the NLRB and in denying his motion for production of a Vaughn Index.","{'Sender': 'Mary Miller Cracraft', 'Sender Role': 'Member of the National Labor Relations Board', 'Recipient': 'Various individuals, including individuals in the Office of the President', 'Recipient Role': 'Unknown', 'About': 'Mary Miller Cracraft', 'About Role': 'Member of the National Labor Relations Board', 'Type': 'Correspondence and fax logs', 'Purpose': 'To secure reappointment to the National Labor Relations Board', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'Unknown', 'Belief': 'Unknown'}",,,[],Not Applicable

[],Not Applicable,"Plaintiff brings this challenge while under the jurisdiction of the United States Parole Commission. Plaintiff was convicted of Kidnaping and Carjacking and sentenced to 20 years in prison on August 6, 1986. While Plaintiff was incarcerated, the parole system became extinct. With the implementation of the sentencing guidelines, federal prisoners no longer become eligible for parole. Prisoners serve out the sentence handed down by the court and then are placed on supervised release for a pre-determined amount of time. Plaintiff, and others convicted under the old system, are still released on discretionary' parole. The Parole Commission still exists to monitor these individuals and the statutes, while repealed, remain in force as applied to those individuals. Plaintiff was released on parole in 1997, revoked and returned to prison in 1999 and re-released in 2000. Plaintiffs parole continues until March 26, 2006.Two years before Plaintiff was convicted, Congress passed the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1994, which required that persons convicted of murder or sex offenses under federal and military law provide a DNA sample to be included in the Combined DNA Index System (“CO-DIS”), a national database. The database allows federal and state law enforcement officers to check evidence found at crime scenes of both past and future crimes, against offenders who have provided a sample. Nearly every state has a similar statute and samples collected by state entities are also included in CODIS.Courts have reviewed a number of DNA collection statutes, and found them to not be penal in nature. Most recently, the Kansas Supreme Court found that its DNA collection law did not constitute a penalty but rather established a process for assisting the identification and detection of crimes. That court held that “[sjtate action in furtherance of achieving those goals is not a penalty or a punishment.” Other courts have held the same.In 2001, the law was amended by the passage of the USA Patriot Act. The Patriot Act extended the DNA sample requirement to other qualifying federal and military felonies, including Kidnaping. Thus, while Plaintiff was on parole, his parole officer advised him that the conditions of his parole now required him to provide a sample of his DNA for inclusion in the database. In addition to adding other qualifying felonies, the Patriot Act also made it a misdemeanor for persons convicted of qualifying felonies to fail to provide a DNA sample. Plaintiff refused to give a sample and filed this lawsuit.","{'Sender': 'Parole officer', 'Sender Role': 'Law enforcement', 'Recipient': 'Plaintiff', 'Recipient Role': 'Parolee', 'About': 'Plaintiff', 'About Role': 'Parolee', 'Type': 'DNA sample', 'Purpose': 'Inclusion in the Combined DNA Index System', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'None'}",,,[],Not Applicable

Officer Ramsey then placed Mr. Smith into the officer’s patrol car, noticing that Mr. Smith appeared to be intoxicated. Officer Ramsey then spoke to Ms. Brawdy and Lannie Coil, both of whom stated that Mr. Smith had come to the residence expressing anger about his sister living with alleged drug dealers. Mr. Smith had proceeded to fire, from the driveway, a number of rounds from a pistol followed by one round from a shotgun.Officer Ramsey asked where the guns were located, and Ms. Brawdy and Mr. Coil stated that Mr. Smith had placed them inside a pickup truck parked in the driveway of the residence. Using a flashlight, Officer Ramsey looked inside the pickup truck and observed a shotgun in the front seat. He also observed a black leather coat, which the witnesses had said the defendant was wearing when he fired the shots. Officer Ramsey opened the door of the truck and removed the shotgun. He then looked through the leather coat and found a .380 pistol in one of the coat’s pockets, which he seized as evidence of a crime. At trial Mr. Coil, Ms. Brawdy, and another witness all testified that they saw Mr. Smith in possession of firearms on October 5,1999.The government also presented the testimony of Raymond Parker, a Special Agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, who testified that both the pistol and the shotgun functioned as firearms and that both were manufactured outside the state of Oklahoma. Mr. Smith stipulated that he had been convicted of a felony prior to October 5,1999.On April 4, 2000, a grand jury in the Western District of Oklahoma returned a one-count indictment against the Mr. Smith, alleging that he had possessed firearms after a previous conviction for a felony offense. Mr. Smith moved to suppress evidence of the firearms, alleging that they were unlawfully seized. The district court denied the motion after a hearing and a jury convicted Mr. Smith.At sentencing, the government maintained that the defendant should be sentenced as an Armed Career Criminal pursuant to the ACCA. Despite Mr. Smith’s objection, the district court agreed and sentenced him to 210 months’ imprisonment. Mr. Smith timely filed a notice of his intent to appeal. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court’s decision.","{'Sender': 'Bonnie Brawdy and Lannie Coil', 'Sender Role': 'None', 'Recipient': 'Police Officer Charles Ramsey', 'Recipient Role': 'Law Enforcement Officer', 'About': 'Mr. Smith', 'About Role': 'None', 'Type': 'Report of shots being fired and possession of firearms', 'Purpose': 'Report of a crime', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'Mr. Smith possessed firearms'}",,,[],Not Applicable
[],Not Applicable,"Late on the afternoon of September 14, 2006, Trower reported that his fiancee, April Aguilar, was missing. Aguilar was in this country on a 90-day marriage visa from the Philippines. Trower called the Trenton, Missouri, Police Department and made several calls to the Grundy County Sheriffs Department in an effort to obtain their assistance in locating Aguilar. Aguilar had left a note for Trower and had apparently taken all her belongings that she had brought with her from the Philippines, but had left the things she had acquired here. Trower believed that a. local couple named Vernon and Nandit Jones either was harboring her or h.ad helped her leave.Upon being contacted by the county sheriffs office, Vernon Jones asked a deputy sheriff to come to his home. . Deputy Clint Griswold responded and was told by Vernon that Aguilar was not happy with her relationship with Trower and that she was frightened of him because he kept a pistol and a large amount of marijuana in his house. Earlier that day while Trower was at work, Aguilar had invited the Joneses over and had showed them the large amount of marijuana that Trower kept in the freezer and the marijuana that he kept on a plate underneath a recliner in the living room. Griswold called Officer Seth Rorebeck of the Trenton Police Department, who was at Trower’s house at the time, telling him that Aguilar was not at the Joneses’ home. He also told Rorebeck about the drugs and gun and then drove to Trower’s home, accompanied by another deputy sheriff.Upon Griswold’s arrival, Trower told the officers that Aguilar had left a note, but that he had misplaced it in his distress. Trower consented to the officers’ request for permission to search for the note and led them through the house to where Aguilar’s remaining items were located. Rorebeck, whom Trower had earlier led throughout the house, stopped briefly in the living room, bent down a few feet from the reeliner, and shined his flashlight underneath, revealing a plate containing marijuana and rolling papers as described by Vernon Jones. In response to Griswold’s inquiry whether they could freely search the house for evidence of a crime or of Aguilar’s current location, Trower said that he had showed the officers everything there was to see. Rorebeck informed Griswold that he had seen the marijuana, whereupon they arrested Trower. A search warrant was obtained for the home, leading to the seizure of the firearm that formed the basis of the present charge.","{'Sender': 'Trower', 'Sender Role': 'Fiancé', 'Recipient': 'Trenton Police Department, Grundy County Sheriffs Department, Deputy Clint Griswold, Officer Seth Rorebeck', 'Recipient Role': 'Law enforcement', 'About': 'April Aguilar', 'About Role': 'Fiancée', 'Type': 'Private information (location, drugs, firearm)', 'Purpose': 'Locate missing person, investigate potential crime', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'Trower believes Aguilar is missing and that Vernon and Nandit Jones may be involved.'}",,,[],Not Applicable

The Packing and Shipyards Office within the Department of Agriculture routinely investigates high volume cattle dealers. Testimony of Keith Kienow, Regional Supervisor, at 16 (Hearing Transcript, April 14, 1986). An investigator from the regional office reviewed Western States’ business records in January of 1985. The records revealed that sellers of cattle had occasionally granted Western States a “pencil shrink” of a certain percentage of the cattle’s total weight to compensate for lost weight during transport. Western States did not always pass the savings from the shrink on to its customers; they sometimes billed the customers for the cattle’s full weight without the shrink allowance.The form invoices used by Western States described the company as “order-buyers,” an ill-defined term that loosely refers to agents who arrange transactions for commissions. Believing that Western States operated solely as agents who bought and sold on commission, the investigator concluded that Western States was possibly defrauding its customers. Id. at 17-21. Further investigation was conducted, including interviews with some of Western States’ customers. The agency filed an administrative complaint isolating twenty suspicious transactions in 1984 primarily involving three customers, Clarence Kenkel, Francis Kenkel of the Lazy K. Farm, and S.L.S. Farms. The complaint alleged that Western States overcharged their three customers and kept inaccurate records. At the close of hearings, the agency withdrew allegations respecting six transactions. The administrative law judge found that the agency’s allegations were substantiated with respect to the remaining fourteen transactions and the judicial officer for the Department of Agriculture affirmed, suspending petitioners’ licenses.","{'Sender': 'Investigator from the regional office', 'Sender Role': 'Unknown', 'Recipient': 'Department of Agriculture', 'Recipient Role': 'Regulatory agency', 'About': 'Western States Cattle Company and its customers', 'About Role': 'Cattle dealer and customers', 'Type': 'Business records', 'Purpose': 'Investigating possible fraud', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'Suspicion of fraud'}",,,[],Not Applicable

On June 13, 1995, Preate pled guilty to a one count Information which charged that he committed mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1342. The Information stated that while District Attorney and a candidate for Attorney General, Preate solicited illegal campaign contributions from the operators of unlawful videopoker gambling machines and failed to properly report the contributions in disclosure forms mailed to the State Board of Elections. The plea agreement required that Preate resign from his position as Attorney General.On October 16, 1995, the court held an in-chambers presentence conference to discuss objections by both parties to the presentence report. A court reporter transcribed the conference and inadvertently filed the transcript on the open docket. When the court learned of the inadvertent filing it ordered that the transcript be sealed.Following the presenteneing conference, the government stated that it wished to introduce evidence at the sentencing hearing which supported allegations addressed in the “offense conduct” section of the presentence report. The government sought to offer this evidence, ostensibly, to assist the court in assessing where in the controlling guideline range Preate should be sentenced. In order to determine whether the government possessed evidence material to Preate’s sentencing which was not adequately covered in the report, the court directed the government to file an in camera proffer of the evidence which it proposed to introduce. The government filed the proffer on November 6, 1995, and the court concluded that the allegations addressed in it were satisfactorily included in the presentence report and therefore the government’s proposed evidence could have no bearing upon Preate’s sentence.On November 13,1995, PG Publishing filed the instant motion to unseal the conference transcript and the United States’ in camera proffer. PG Publishing concurrently moved, without explanation, for a highly expedited briefing schedule under which the opposition brief was to be filed on November 15, 1995.

The Third- Circuit denied PG Publishing’s mandamus petition on January 17, 1996.

Pursuant to the City’s policies, Rizzi established a residence within the City. However, Rizzi’s wife and children did not move with Rizzi to the City; they remained at their previous residence outside of the City.On June 14, 1997, the City and Jerry Ge-nova (“Genova”), the mayor of the City, extended Rizzi’s probationary period by an additional ninety days, during which time Genova required Rizzi (1) to purchase a residence within the City, (2) to move his wife and children to the residence, and (3) to enroll his children in the City’s schools. Rizzi, however, was unable to purchase a residence within the ninety-day period. Thus, on September 12, 1997, the City moved to terminate Rizzi’s employment without first providing him with any notice or a hearing.Promptly after the termination, Rizzi filed a written request for a hearing before the defendant the Calumet City Police and Fire Commission (“the Commission”).

On November 26, 2001, defense counsel sent a letter to plaintiffs counsel requesting permission to have the claims handler with settlement authority participate in the mediation by telephone. On November 27, 2001, plaintiffs counsel sent a response letter, objecting “vehemently” because he believed the mediation would be a “waste of time” if defendant did not send someone to the mediation with settlement authority. Plaintiffs counsel further stated: “If you insist on not participating fully, I would suggest that we contact the Court immediately so that this issue may be resolved well in advance of the mediation.” Plaintiffs counsel heard nothing further from defense counsel about this issue.On December 13, 2001, defense counsel came to the mediation and was accompanied by Scott Glow, a representative of defendant’s liability insurance carrier, Carolina Casualty Insurance Company. Before the mediation, Carolina Casualty decided that it would give Glow authority to pay up to $25,000 to settle all of plaintiffs claims. When the mediation commenced, plaintiffs counsel communicated that the mediation was being conducted only to settle plaintiffs personal injury claims, but not the potential invasion of privacy claim plaintiff has not yet sued upon. Accordingly, Glow called Tony Sarehet, a representative in Carolina Casualty’s home office, and Sarehet told Glow that he was authorized to pay only $20,000 if the settlement would not effect a release of plaintiffs invasion of privacy claim. Mediation proceeded, and the parties reached an impasse. Plaintiffs last demand was $32,500, and defendant’s final offer was $20,000.Plaintiff now seeks sanctions against defendant for its failure to send a representative to the mediation who had authority to settle plaintiffs claims.I","{'Sender': 'Defense counsel', 'Sender Role': 'Legal representative for Defendant', 'Recipient': ""Plaintiff's counsel"", 'Recipient Role': 'Legal representative for Plaintiff', 'About': ""Plaintiff's personal injury claims and potential invasion of privacy claim"", 'About Role': 'Plaintiff', 'Type': 'Settlement authority', 'Purpose': 'Mediation for settlement of claims', 'In Reply To': ""Defense counsel's letter requesting permission to have the claims handler with settlement authority participate in the mediation by telephone"", 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'Plaintiff\'s counsel believed the mediation would be a ""waste of time"" if defendant did not send someone to the mediation with settlement authority'}",,,[],Not Applicable

This court has dealt with other issues arising from this ease in Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 90 F.3d 553 (D.C.Cir.1996) (petition for rehearing in banc pending), Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274 (D.C.Cir.1993), and Armstrong v. Bush, 924 F.2d 282 (D.C.Cir.1991). The district court has issued numerous orders and opinions.Armstrong’s original FOIA request was for all documents from the Reagan Administration found in the Professional Office System (PROFS) maintained by the Executive Office of the President (EOP) and the National Security Council (NSC). PROFS is an office automation system that contains information such as e-mail correspondence, mem-oranda, and calendars. This initial request was for an enormous number of documents.The number of documents requested has been substantially reduced over the course of this litigation. In February 1992, appellant narrowed his request to a subset of the PROFS materials. In September of that year the district court entered a stipulation and order that the government process and release PROFS materials that had already been printed out in hard copy. In January 1994, the district court entered another order, further narrowing the scope of appellant’s request and ordering the government to comply. The scope of the request has been further limited by an agreement between the parties.In response to these requests, the government has released a substantial number of documents, many of which have had portions redacted. Appellant has, over the years, challenged these redactions and the government has responded to some of these challenges by releasing the requested documents in full. The remaining redacted documents are described in the Vaughn index prepared for this litigation.The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. Appellant requested that the district court review 17 documents in camera, urged the court to compel the disclosure of the names of lower-level FBI agents who attended White House meetings, and challenged the government’s failure to disclose a one-page Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) document. The district court ruled that it would review four documents in camera, but upheld the government’s refusal to disclose the names of the FBI agents and the OSTP document. After reviewing the four documents in camera, along with an in camera affidavit supplied by the government, the district court held that all of the redactions were justified. The issue regarding the OSTP document has been mooted by the government’s disclosure of the document.

[],Not Applicable,"Perry received a credit solicitation mailing from First National, dated February 14, 2005, offering her a pre-approved Visa credit card with a $250 limit. The mailing contained a letter as well as a brochure setting forth the terms and conditions of the offer. One paragraph of the brochure, titled “Fair Credit Report Act Notice” (“Notice”) advised recipients in bold letters that “the credit bureau gave us your name and address and indicated that you met our minimum credit criteria,” and that “you can tell credit bureaus to stop using your credit information for this purpose.” The solicitation letter itself does not specifically refer to the Notice.Perry did not authorize First National to access her consumer credit report. She alleges that First National accessed her consumer report and used a consumer reporting agency to target certain people, e.g., individuals with poor credit or individuals who recently obtained bankruptcy discharges, for sub-prime credit offers.Perry alleged in her complaint that First National violated 15 U.S.C. § 1681m(d) by failing to include a “clear and conspicuous” statement of certain disclosures required by the FCRA. Perry tried to introduce the report of Timothy Shanahan (“Shanahan report”), a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago, to support her argument that the Notice was not “clear and conspicuous.” The Shanahan report included a “legibility analysis.”The district court found that Perry did not have a statutory right to bring a private cause of action under § 1681m(d), due to a 2003 amendment to the FCRA that eliminated the right to bring such actions. The district court therefore granted summary judgment for First National. The district court also granted First National’s motion to strike Shanahan’s report, explaining that “[bjecause no private right of action exists under § 1681m, an evaluation of the Notice is not relevant to the instant case.”Perry also argued that even if her claim under § 1681m(d) could not succeed, she should be allowed to amend her complaint to plead a violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(c)(l)(B)(i). Section 1681b(c)(l)(B)(i) permits a consumer credit agency to furnish a consumer report even though the consumer has not initiated or authorized the release only if the credit or insurance provider is extending the consumer a “firm offer of credit.” Perry contends that the credit solicitation was not a firm offer of credit because it was for such a small amount of credit that it was virtually worthless. The district court disagreed and found that Perry could not state a claim under § 1681b(c)(1)(B)(i), because First National’s credit offer was a “firm offer of credit.” The district court denied Perry’s motion to amend, finding that although the minimum amount of credit that First National offered was small, the interest rate was clear, approval was guaranteed, and the credit card did not contain usage limitations.","{'Sender': 'First National ', 'Sender Role': 'Credit company ', 'Recipient': 'Perry ', 'Recipient Role': 'Consumer ', 'About': ""Perry's credit report "", 'About Role': 'Consumer ', 'Type': 'Credit report information ', 'Purpose': 'Credit solicitation ', 'In Reply To': 'None ', 'Consented By': 'Perry ', 'Belief': ""First National accessed Perry's credit report without authorization""}",,,[],Not Applicable

Nevertheless, Coleman continued receiving prerecorded automated calls from Rite Aid.On March 14, 2017, Coleman filed suit against Rite Aid asserting three claims.

The Supreme Court has explained this standard as follows:A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.

Lorenzo, Carpenter, and Richardson are all citizens of Louisiana so the parties are not completely diverse in citizenship. State Farm removed the case contending that Lorenzo improperly joined Carpenter and Richardson such that their citizenship can be ignored for purposes of determining jurisdiction. Specifically, State Farm argues that Lorenzo’s cause of action does not fall within the confines of the Louisiana Supreme Court’s decision in Canter v.

A TPS customer using this service is assigned a single telephone number, and the customer’s incoming calls are routed to any one of several other telephone numbers used by the customer. TPS allegedly purchased the facsimile number list containing Foxhall’s number from a marketing services firm in New York.

Foxhall claims that the advertisement it received was sent without its prior permission and was therefore a violation of 47 U.S.C. § 227. Section 227(b)(1)(C) prohibits the “use [of] any telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other device to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine.” Section 227(b)(3) provides for a private right of action in the following terms:A person or entity may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State, bring in an appropriate court of that State — •(A) an action based on a violation of this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin such violation,(B) an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation, or to receive $500 in damages for each such violation, whichever is greater, or(C) both such actions.If the court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection, the court may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount available under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(3).Following International Science, the district court held that the TCPA creates a private right of action for violations of § 227(b)(1)(C), but that state courts have exclusive jurisdiction over such causes of action under the terms of § 227(b)(3).

Ex. 1 (plaintiffs FOIA request). This memorandum was prepared during the course of an investigation conducted by the Department of Justice, Office of Special Investigations (“OSI”), into the wartime conduct of one Arthur Rudolph. Mr. Rudolph served as Operations Director of a V-2 rocket production facility at the Mittelwerke complex near Niedersachswerfen in Centeral Germany. See Compl. Ex. 5. Allegations had been made that Mr. Rudolph participated in atrocities perpetuated on slave laborers used by the Nazi regime.After World War II, Mr. Rudolph relocated to the United States, became a citizen and participated in this country’s space exploration effort, assisting in the design of the Saturn V rocket and earning the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Distinguished Service Medal. After the allegations against him were made and he was under investigation by OSI, Mr. Rudolph voluntarily renounced his U.S. citizenship and returned to Germany in 1984. He resided there until his death last year. Believing that Mr. Rudolph was ill-treated by the Justice Department, plaintiff conducted a private investigation of the allegations of wartime misdeeds. Toward this end, and with the explicit permission of Mr. Rudolph, plaintiff filed the FOIA request at issue in this case. See Compl.

Unbeknownst to the thieves, the car was equipped with a tracking device made by defendant LoJack Corporation (“LoJack”). The tracking device led police to a garage in East Frankford, where the stolen car was discovered. Evidence gathered at that garage in turn led police to probe another group of garages. A raid of the garages on July 21, 1997, yielded 18 stolen automobiles and four arrests. Among those arrested was plaintiff Peter Fanelle (“Fanelle”). Fanelle was later found not guilty of the charges stemming from his arrest.The Philadelphia Inquirer ran an article about the vehicle recoveries and arrests on July 23, 1997. The article named Fa-nelle as one of the four arrestees and included a “mug shot” of Fanelle. In his complaint, Fanelle alleges that in August 1998, it was “brought to (his) attention ... that promotional literature and/or a brochure prepared by agents, servants and/or employees of Lojack Corporation had been distributed in Philadelphia County and elsewhere which employed the use of the July 23, 1997 article.... ” (Complaint, at ¶10).The brochure, entitled “LoJack Stolen Vehicle Police Recovery Network,” included national and local statistics on car thefts, the above-mentioned Philadelphia Inquirer article in which Fanelle appears, testimonials and vignettes about car thefts and the effectiveness of the Lojack system, a reproduction of a Business Week magazine article about Lojack, an award certificate given to LoJack by Consumers Digest, and a break-down of typical costs to the victim associated with car theft.

Rienks, Jr., filed suit in the Denver District Court against Bob and Cheri Lynde, seeking to collect on a promissory note of which she is the holder. The note was originally executed by Bob and Cheri Lynde in favor of George W. Rienks, Jr. The promissory note had been executed and delivered as payment for stock in a Colorado Corporation (“LZP, Inc.”) purchased by petitioners from George W. Rienks, Jr. Mr. Rienks subsequently died and Margaret Rienks succeeded to her husband’s interest in the note. After the Lyndes failed to make payment under the note, Margaret Rienks commenced suit. Petitioners then filed a counterclaim asserting, inter alia, claims of misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment by George W. Rienks, Jr. relating to his alleged involvement in an illegal “kickback scheme” that artificially inflated the value of the LZP, Inc. stock at the time of sale.The Lyndes then requested the court to release the testimony of George W. Rienks, Jr. given at a grand jury proceeding prior to his death. The motion for release of the grand jury testimony alleged that “[George W. Reinks, Jr.’s] testimony [was] needed for evidentiary purposes in a ... civil action ... wherein [the movants] are defending an action brought by the widow of George W. Rienks, Jr., Margaret Rienks, for the enforcement of a note,” and that the grand jury testimony “would be extremely helpful to the movants’ defense of their case.” The district judge issued an order calling for objections from interested persons in opposition to the release of the transcripts. Two objections were filed, advancing substantially the same arguments, one by Margaret Rienks, and the other by Michael J. Zachary. After considering the objections, the district court entered an order denying the petition for release of George Rienks’s grand jury testimony. In its order, the district court ruled that disclosure of grand jury testimony requires a strong showing of particularized need and that petitioners had failed to make such a showing. The district court further stated that although it believed the transcripts would be relevant to the present civil action, it had “grave doubts that the jury would ever be permitted to see the statements,” based on the uncontested assertion that the testimony would be inadmissible hearsay under Colo.R.Evid. 804(b)(1), thus “without value at trial.”","{'Sender': 'Bob and Cheri Lynde', 'Sender Role': 'Defendants in a civil action', 'Recipient': 'Denver District Court', 'Recipient Role': 'Legal authority', 'About': 'George W.

[],Not Applicable,"As stated in several opinions by this court, the underlying allegations in this case arise from what has become popularly known as “Filegate.” According to their complaint, plaintiffs allege that their privacy interests were violated when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) improperly handed over to the White House hundreds of FBI files of former political appointees and government employees under the Reagan and Bush Administrations.On April 13, 1998, this court issued an order permitting plaintiffs to pursue discovery into matters bearing on the obtaining and misuse of governmental files in order for plaintiffs to attempt to create the inference that it is reasonable to conclude that FBI files were obtained and misused in the instant case. Alexander v. FBI, C.A. No. 96-2123(RCL), Mem. and Order at 6 (D.D.C. Apr. 13, 1998). Pursuant to that memorandum and order, plaintiffs have pursued their theory that the White House had some role in the release of information from the federal security-clearance form of Linda Tripp. To this end, plaintiffs served Clifford Bernath, former Principal Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, with a subpoena ad testificandum and duces te-cum.The subpoena commanded Bernath to appear for deposition on April 24, 1998. On April 23, the government defendants filed a motion for protective order with respect to the deposition of Bernath. In their opposition to the government defendants’ motion, plaintiffs requested that this court impose sanctions on the government defendants including attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by plaintiffs in preparing the opposition and associated expenses incurred in canceling the deposition. This court denied the government defendants’ motion for protective order on April 27, and ordered Bernath to appear to be deposed the following day. The court also indicated that the issue of attorneys’ fees and costs would be considered separately.On the evening of April 27, the government defendants filed a motion to amend the court’s order issued earlier that day on the basis that Bernath was in Kansas and accordingly, would not be available to be deposed by plaintiffs on April 28. Bernath was eventually deposed by plaintiffs on April 30.After conducting the deposition of Ber-nath, plaintiffs filed a motion to compel further testimony and production of documents from Bernath and requested that this court impose sanctions upon counsel for the government defendants and Bernath. Prior to considering this motion, the court must address plaintiffs’ request for attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in filing an opposition to the government defendants’ original motion for protective order as the request is based on facts immediately preceding Bernath’s deposition.","{'Sender': 'FBI', 'Sender Role': 'Government agency', 'Recipient': 'White House', 'Recipient Role': 'Government agency', 'About': 'Former political appointees and government employees', 'About Role': 'None', 'Type': 'FBI files and federal security-clearance form', 'Purpose': 'Unknown', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'The privacy interests of the plaintiffs were violated.'}",,,[],Not Applicable
[],Not Applicable,"In 1982 the Drug Enforcement Administration investigated and found baseless certain allegations that then-U.S. Senator Dan Quayle had used cocaine. During the 1992 presidential campaign, renewed speculation in the media about Quayle’s alleged cocaine use led AUSA John Thar, of the Southern District of Indiana, to disclose the findings of the 1982 investigation to the Indianapolis Star with the following explanation:I’m disclosing what I have, with approval, simply because so much has been made out of nothing_ It’s all been so misconstrued. ... I’m making an honest disclosure of what was found, hoping to put an end to it.James A. Gillaspy, Feds Reveal Details of Quayle Drug Probe, Indianapolis Star, Nov. 13, 1991, at 1. The Star described Thar’s disclosure as “a rare departure from the Department of Justice policy of withholding comment about any investigation.” The Office of Professional Responsibility, which handles allegations of improper conduct by DOJ officials, investigated the disclosure. In response to an inquiry from the press Thar acknowledged that he was disciplined as a result of the OPR investigation at a level of severity somewhere between “you’ve done something wrong” and “you’re fired.” Aaron M. Freiwald, Quayle Accuser Presses Conspiracy Claims, Legal Times, March 30,1992 at 1, 20.In 1994 Kimberlin sought disclosure pursuant to the FOIA of “all papers, documents and things pertaining to the OPR investigation” of Thar. Initially the OPR gave a standard Glomar response, refusing either to confirm or to deny that such an investigation had taken place. Cf. Phillippi v. CIA, 546 F.2d 1009, 1011 (D.C.Cir.1976) (CIA refused to confirm or deny existence of information regarding research vessel Glomar Explorer). When Kimberlin brought suit in district court to compel disclosure and confronted the OPR with evidence that Thar had acknowledged publicly that the OPR had investigated his disclosure to the Star, the OPR withdrew its Glomar response and released two press clippings from its file on the investigation. The OPR withheld the balance of the file on the ground that it comes within Exemption 7(C) to the FOIA, which provides that an agency may withhold “records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes” to the extent that the production thereof “could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C).The district court reviewed in ■ camera some or all of the OPR file, together with a memorandum from the Government detailing its reasons for withholding the contents of the file. Upon cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court held that “the Government has properly invoked Exemption 7(C) and may continue to withhold such information from public disclosure.” Kimber-lin v.

[],Not Applicable,"Sonya Stewart, an employee at the Department of Commerce, alleges that Frank DeGeorge, when he was Inspector General of the Department, berated her with a tirade of profanity in a telephone conversation on May 3,1996. Stewart reported the incident to an equal employment opportunity counselor within the Department and eventually filed a formal complaint. Thereafter the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigated the situation, and the Department ultimately notified Stewart that her claim had been rejected.According to Stewart, between the time' she first reported the incident and the time she received the Department’s final decision, the Acting General Counsel of the Department, Sue Esserman; the Assistant General Counsel for Administration, Barbara Fredericks; and the Chief of the Employment Law Division, Kathleen Taylor, all engaged in various acts of retaliation against her. Stewart also claims to have kept detailed notes about the initial incident and the acts of retaliation, including notes about “strategies for pursuing her claim.” Stewart says she initially kept these notes and related documents in her office at the Department but later agreed to give them to John Sopko, Chief Counsel of the Special Matters Unit, to be kept in part in a safe and in part in a locked cabinet. Stewart claims she agreed to give Sopko the documents only upon being assured that no one, including specifically Fredericks and Taylor, would see them. Fredericks and Taylor knew about this ai’rangement but nonetheless reviewed the files while Stewart was on sick leave in August, 1998.In February, 2000 Stewart sued the Department under Title VII for the abusive comments and the retaliation, and sued Fredericks and Taylor under the Fourth Amendment for reading her private papers. The district court granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss the claims. The court reasoned that the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 2301-2305, which established a system of administrative remedies for improper actions by supervisors in the federal workplace, precludes Stewart from recovering under the Fourth Amendment for the allegedly illegal search. The court also ruled that the profane tirade to which she was allegedly subjected did not constitute sex discrimination, and that none of the alleged acts of retaliation constituted an “adverse employment action” under Title VII.

As they did so, A.L. testified that Viney ""looked up at us and we looked at him and then he looked down and we looked down and he exposed himself."" In exposing himself, A.L. testified that Viney ""pulled his shorts up"" and ""to the side."" Throughout the encounter, Viney said nothing to the girls and did not motion for them to approach him.At trial, Viney testified that he was at the school cleaning his car, but that he did not intentionally expose himself to the girls. Viney testified that he was wearing basketball shorts and an athletic supporter that was old, ""stretched out in places,"" and ""quite a bit worn."" Because of the condition of the athletic supporter, Viney stated that, ""if something fell out, I mean it's possible. I'm not denying that, but there was no lascivious intent.

In denying the motion at the conclusion of all the evidence, the trial court stated:I have no doubt that what these - particularly what [A.L.] told me is anything but the truth. I believe her one hundred percent and this can't happen two ways. It can only happen one way and I believe what she told me.The real issue here is whether or not there is lascivious intent and I believe there was based on his actions, the motioning of the eyes and to direct their attention to his groin area and then he pulls up his shorts.He says it never happened. He says if it did, it was an accident and I just don't believe that.The trial court found Viney guilty of both offenses as charged and sentenced Viney to serve a total of four years in prison, with three years suspended.On appeal, the Court of Appeals considered the same issue now before this Court: whether the evidence was sufficient to prove that Viney acted with lascivious intent.

Schepis's police car was equipped with a camera that could read license plates in order to provide information about the vehicle and the vehicle's registered owner to law enforcement officers. The record check performed by the license plate camera indicated that Traft, the vehicle's registered owner, had an active warrant for failing to appear in Court. Schepis turned and followed Traft, and eventually pulled the vehicle over. Traft asserts that it is undisputed that he committed no traffic infractions while Schepis followed him.Based on his knowledge that the owner of the vehicle was subject to a warrant for failure to appear, Schepis stopped the vehicle registered to Traft. As it turned out, Traft was the driver. Once he stopped the truck, Schepis noticed several signs that Traft was intoxicated. According to the citation, Traft failed field sobriety tests, admitted to drinking too many beers, and had a blood, alcohol level of nearly twice the legal limit according to Schepis's portable breathalyzer. Schepis arrested Traft for driving under the influence and on an outstanding warrant for failure to appear in court.At trial, Traft filed a motion to suppress the traffic stop, arguing that Schepis violated his right to privacy when he reviewed his license and registration information for no reason.

Several women who lived at the apartment building helped Harrison by storing drugs and money for him and on occasion dealing for him. In October 1992 Washington police officers, pursuant to a valid warrant, entered and searched Apartment 507 at 601 Virginia Avenue, the home of Dominga Montivero and her daughter Daniela. The police found 45 grams of crack cocaine in 119 ziplock bags under the kitchen sink. Dominga Montivero told the police that the drugs belonged to Harrison and that he would be returning for them.

The parties agreed to an extension of time to January 17, 2006 for petitioner to comply with the subpoena. After the parties were unable to agree to a further extension, the government filed in camera for an order to show cause why the petitioner should not be held in contempt for failure to complete the exemplar. Petitioner filed an in camera motion for an order continuing his appearance to afford him the opportunity to research and file a motion to quash the subpoena. (Doc. S-3). On January 20, 2006, the Court held an in camera telephone hearing to discuss the status of this matter. At the hearing, the Court granted petitioner’s motion for extension of time to file a motion to quash the subpoena, and set the February 2, 2006 in camera hearing on the motion to quash and the government’s motion for an order to show cause. Petitioner submitted the motion to quash (Doc. S — 13) and a memorandum in support of the motion (Doc. S-15) on January 31, 2006. The government submitted its response (Doc. S — 16) at the February 2, 2006 hearing. The government’s’ motion for an order to show cause and petitioner’s motion to quash are considered in conjunction.The grand jury seeks a handwriting exemplar from petitioner in furtherance of a criminal tax investigation. The government posits that Supreme Court precedent clearly establishes that a handwriting exemplar provided by the target of a criminal investigation does not implicate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Petitioner assails the government’s position and states that the overwhelming majority of publications by handwriting and psychological experts establish that handwriting itself is an “intellectual process,” and compelling an individual to provide an exemplar impermissibly delves into the mind of the individual; thus, the giving of the exemplar is not just a physical act, but a testimonial and communicative exercise in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Petitioner further states that requiring such an exemplar violates the Fourth Amendment because he has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his handwriting. Petitioner finally argues that the government has failed to show that the subpoena is relevant to the grand jury investigation. The government responds that procuring a handwriting exemplar does not implicate the Fourth Amendment because petitioner does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his signature or writing, and that the handwriting exemplar is relevant to the tax fraud investigation.","{'Sender': 'Government', 'Sender Role': 'Law enforcement', 'Recipient': 'Petitioner', 'Recipient Role': 'Individual', 'About': 'Petitioner', 'About Role': 'Individual subject of criminal investigation', 'Type': 'Handwriting exemplar', 'Purpose': 'Criminal tax investigation', 'In Reply To': 'Grand jury subpoena', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'The government argues that a handwriting exemplar does not implicate Fifth Amendment rights and is relevant to the investigation, while the petitioner argues that it is testimonial in nature and violates both the Fifth and Fourth Amendments.'}",,,[],Not Applicable

At the suppression hearing, appellant and the State stipulated that a City of Webster police officer, Clyde Pray, who supplied the sole affidavit in support of the request for a warrant to search appellant’s premises, had conducted an investigation in Friends-wood, Texas, outside the city limits of Webster. Officer Pray testified in his affidavit that he conducted an undercover investigation of the premises, located in a strip shopping center in Friendswood, after receiving information about a “possible game room containing multiple illegal gambling devices commonly referred to as 8-liners.” Officer Pray testified that he rang a door bell and was invited into the premises on three occasions and played on machines that fit the definition of “gambling device” found in the Texas Penal Code. See Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 47.01(4). A district court in Harris County signed a search warrant authorizing the seizure of gambling devices, money, and other evidence. While Officer Pray executed the search, appellant arrived on the scene and admitted to running the operation and owning the machines. Officer Pray seized, among other things, ninety-six circuit boards and approximately $27,907 in cash.Appellant was arrested and charged by information, and the trial court denied his motion to suppress.

These disclosures would also reveal that each employee had been fired or quit as a result of the background investigation.On January 13, 1997, the MTEA and the seven employees filed a lawsuit seeking de novo review of the decision to release the information sought by the Journal Sentinel. The circuit court conducted an evidentiary hearing on January 21, 1997. The circuit court, however, did not engage in a de novo review of the decision to release the records. Instead, the circuit court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to address the merits.

[],Not Applicable,"We briefly recite the basic facts relevant to the disposition of this case. Freeman and several fellow corrections officers were arrested as a result of a County investigation of corrections officers suspected of receiving disability benefits on the basis of fraudulent job injury claims. DOC surveillance efforts yielded incriminating evidence regarding certain corrections officers, all of whom were on paid disability leave. An employee from DOC’s Special Investigations Unit telephoned those corrections officers and directed them to report to DOC headquarters on Monday, July 12,1999.Upon arrival, each summoned corrections officer was placed in a separate room. Sometime thereafter, each was placed under arrest by officers from the Department of Public Safety (“DPS”), handcuffed, and then transported to the police station. A County employee videotaped Freeman and the other arrestees walking through the DOC parking lot as they were escorted from the DOC building, where they were arrested, to the cars in which they were transported to the police station for booking.On the same day, the County held a press conference to publicize its investigation of and crackdown on fraudulent job injury claims by corrections officers. County Executive Spano announced the arrests and played the videotape made by the County employee of the arrested corrections officers as they were escorted from the DOC building to waiting cars. Copies of the videotape were distributed to the media.In addition, the Commissioner of Public Safety informed those present that “after the arrests these people were transported to the Westchester County police headquarters, processed, and they’re pending arraignment right now in the Town of Mt. Pleasant Court.” Caldarola, 142 F.Supp.2d at 435.

[],Not Applicable,"On December 20, 2006, Sprauer, an off-duty police officer employed by the Town of Jupiter, was pulled over in the City of Stuart by Stuart Police Officer George McLane. McLane, concerned that Sprauer might be intoxicated, summoned Stuart Police Officer Matthew Cernuto to the scene because Cernuto’s vehicle contained a video camera. The officers gave Sprauer roadside sobriety tests which were videotaped, and administered traffic citations, but did not arrest Sprauer for driving under the influence of alcohol.Thereafter, the Jupiter Police Department obtained a copy of the videotape of the field sobriety tests from the Stuart Police Department. An internal affairs investigation was commenced by Jupiter Police Chief Frank Kitzeimw to determine if Sprauer had violated the police department’s rules and if discipline was warranted. Kitzerow assigned Captain Scott De Atley and Lieutenant David England to conduct the investigation. The investigators found, inter alia, that Sprauer drove under the influence of alcohol on December 20, 2006 and improperly attempted to use his position as a police officer to avoid arrest. A pre-termination hearing was held before Kitzerow, after which he concluded that Sprauer was impaired when stopped by the Stuart police. Kitzerow recommended to Jupiter Town Manager Andrew Lukasik that Sprauer be disciplined for policy violations, and possibly terminated. Lukasik issued a letter, rejecting Sprauer’s contention that the videotape had been “tampered with in an effort to develop a case” against him, and terminating Sprauer’s employment. Pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, Sprauer was afforded a post-termination hearing before an independent arbitrator. Following the hearing, the arbitrator ordered that Sprauer’s employment be reinstated, but did not award recovery for lost pay or benefits.Sprauer thereafter brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging, inter alia, violations of procedural due process, substantive due process, and equal protection rights. Following the defendants’ motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (“Rule”) 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, the district court dismissed Sprauer’s eom-plaint, but permitted Sprauer leave to amend. Sprauer filed an amended complaint and the defendants filed another Rule 12(b)(6) motion. The motion was referred to a magistrate judge, who issued a report and recommendation advising that the district court grant the Rule 12(b)(6) motion. The report and recommendation was adopted by the district court in its entirety and Sprauer’s complaint was dismissed with prejudice.Sprauer appeals, arguing that: (1) his complaint properly alleges violations of his substantive due process rights; and (2) the defendants are not entitled to sovereign or official immunity.II.

After business hours on July 26, 2006, and August 7, 2006, aluminum wheels, radiators, and condensers were stolen from West Imports, a Henry County scrap metal business. The thefts were captured on the business’ videotape surveillance system. No one at West Imports could identify the perpetrator who was observed committing larceny on the July 26 videotape, but the business’ owner, George Westmoreland, believed he recognized someone named “Michael or Mike” on the videotape from August 7, 2006. This individual had previously sold scrap metal to Westmoreland on several occasions. One of Westmoreland’s employees, who also watched the August 7 videotape, recognized the thief as his neighbor on Jones Ridge Road.Westmoreland contacted the police early on the morning of August 8, 2006, and gave this information to Sergeant Troy Easter. Sergeant Easter, after viewing the August 7 videotape, then went to appellant’s home on Jones Ridge Road, approximately two miles from the business. When he arrived at the home between 7:00 a.m. and 8:30 a.m., Sergeant Easter observed numerous car parts and some apparently inoperable vehicles sitting in the yard around the house. The house had no fencing around it, and the property was not posted with any “no trespassing” signs.Sergeant Easter approached the front door and knocked, but no one answered. The sergeant then walked around the left side of the house and knocked on a side door. No one answered. Sergeant Easter then walked to the back of the house to see “if anybody might be around the back.” As he walked into the backyard, he observed wheels and radiators like those stolen from West Imports sitting both in the open and behind a red shed situated on the opposite side of the yard, approximately twenty-five to thirty yards behind the house. The backyard was cluttered with a variety of other car parts. The red shed was the only structure in the yard.Sergeant Easter then returned to the front of the house in order to call Westmoreland from his patrol car and ask him to come to the house on Jones Ridge Road. At this point, appellant came out of the house. When Westmoreland arrived at the house, he identified the tires, radiators, and condensers in the backyard as the stolen items.Appellant moved to suppress the evidence of the stolen goods and any derivative evidence, including appellant’s subsequent confession to the July 26 theft and the August 7 theft, contending that Sergeant Easter conducted a warrantless search of his property in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The trial court found that Sergeant Easter was lawfully in appellant’s backyard trying to see if appellant was home that morning so as to question him when Sergeant Easter observed the stolen items in plain view. The trial court ruled that the plain view doctrine was applicable in this case, and, therefore, the court denied appellant’s suppression motion.

When the officers showed Jackson’s picture to Joseph, she professed not to recognize him but the officers judged from her body language that she was lying. Still without entering the apartment, the officers next showed Jackson’s picture to Tyneesha Barbary, who was sitting nearby. (As it happens, Barbary was Jackson’s girlfriend and was pregnant with his child.) When the officers asked Barbary if Jackson was in the apartment, she started to cry and nodded her head. The officers subsequently entered the apartment and followed Barbary to a back bedroom where Jackson was sleeping with Barbary’s daughter. After handcuffing Jackson, the officers searched the immediate area and found a pistol within grabbing distance under the blanket on which he had been sleeping.Although he was initially arrested for aggravated battery, Jackson was ultimately charged in federal court with possession of a firearm by a previously-convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922. The district court denied Jackson’s motion to suppress the gun that was seized during the arrest, finding that the search was lawful because the police reasonably believed that Jackson was within Joseph’s apartment when they entered.

[],Not Applicable,"The charges against appellant arose from a complex series of financial transactions she conducted during 1985 and 1986 from her apartment in Washington, D.C. The wire fraud charges were based on appellant’s solicitation of loan applications from a number of persons and the subsequent transfer of funds by two interested borrowers into an account controlled by appellant. The government’s evidence, uncontradicted by appellant, showed that appellant claimed that she could procure large loans from a group of offshore lenders and that she was a trustee of funds for these lenders. The evidence further showed that appellant represented to the potential borrowers that they would have to deposit certain funds into an escrow account as evidence that they intended to complete the loan applications and accept the loans, but that these funds would be fully refunded if the lenders failed to make the loans. Appellant’s activities ultimately resulted in the wire transfer of funds into this account by two of the interested borrowers, James Whatley and Robert Capuano. The loans were never funded, and the monies deposited by Whatley and Capuano were never returned.The false personation counts were based on appellant’s representations while offering bonds or large quantities of commodities for sale to three potential purchasers, Leo Hansen, Harold Gardner, and Charles Waggoner. The government’s evidence, again uncontradicted by appellant, showed that appellant represented herself to these individuals as a “Special Consultant” to the United States Department of the Treasury (“Treasury Department”) in connection with the U.S. Recycle Program, an enterprise appellant claimed to be operating under special authorization from the Treasury Department. She further claimed that she was authorized by the government to solicit loans in exchange for “special issue” Treasury Bonds and to sell government-owned and other commodities, with the proceeds going to the government. The Treasury Department, in fact, had never retained appellant in any capacity and had no official connections with the U.S. Recycle Program.During the government’s investigation of appellant’s activities, a Secret Service agent applied for and received a warrant to search appellant’s apartment. The search warrant was executed in late March of 1986, resulting in the seizure of a large quantity of appellant’s business records and equipment.

During these conversations, Defendant repeatedly attempted to persuade “TAMIJOANN” to meet him in a motel room in order to engage in various sexual acts. In addition, on June 30, 1998, on three separate occasions, Defendant transmitted three different images of minors involved in sexually explicit conduct to “TAMIJOANN” via computer.

Then, at 6:10 a.m., Defendant sent an image labeled “10YRWHOR.JPG.” This is a compilation of seven pictures, five of which depict a prepubescent female having oral and anal sex with an adult male subject, one depicting the same prepubescent female displaying her genitalia while lying on top of an adult male, and one depicting two adult males and one prepubescent male urinating on the prepubescent female. Finally, at 6:14 a.m., Defendant sent an image entitled “12YOFFUK.JPG” which depicts a prepubescent female having sexual intercourse with a male subject.After Defendant’s guilty plea to all counts in the indictment, the probation officer filed a presentence report in which she recommended that the first three offenses not be grouped for the purposes of sentencing. After receiving that report, Defendant filed written objections, including an objection to the Probation Officer’s failure to group the first three charges. Defendant objected to the failure to group solely on the ground that “[t]here are no victims under Counts One, Two and Three.

The emails asked about buying sassafras oil, an ingredient in ecstasy. The DEA, which had been monitoring the website, sent an administrative subpoena to Microsoft Corporation (the owner of Hotmail, the web-based email service for @hotmail.com email addresses). The subpoena asked for:[A]ll basic subscriber information, including the subscriber’s name, address, length of service (including start date) and types of services used including any temporarily assigned network address, Passport.net accounts, means and source of payment (including credit card or bank account number), and the account login histories (IP Login history) of, the following email account(s): gslabs® hotmail.com.For this case, the request for “account login histories (IP Login history)” is key. Internet Protocol (abbreviated as “I.P.”) addresses are used to identify computers connected to the internet. The allocation of addresses is centrally managed so one can look up in a public registry which internet service provider “owns” a particular address.Responding to the subpoena, Microsoft gave the DEA information about instances in which the gslabs@hotmail.com account was accessed between July 5 and September 15, 2008. For each instance, Microsoft provided the date, time, and an I.P. address associated with the computer that accessed the account. The DEA saw that 24.15.180.222 was an I.P. address frequently used to access the account, so it sent an administrative subpoena to Comcast Corporation (the owner of that I.P. address). The subpoena asked for:Any and all e-mail addresses associated with [24.15.180.222]; a) customer name and other user name(s); b) addresses; c) records of session times and durations; d) length of service (including start date) and types of service used; e) telephone or instrument number or other subscriber number or identity, including any temporarily assigned network address; and f) means and source of payment for such service (including any credit card or bank account numbers).Comcast responded that the address was assigned to Anna Caira, and Comcast gave the DEA Anna’s home address. The investigation continued from there and culminated in Anna’s husband, Frank Caira, being charged with possessing and conspiring to manufacture illegal drugs, in violation of 21 U.S.C. sections 841(a)(1) and 846.Caira moved to suppress evidence obtained through the subpoenas, arguing that the government’s inquiry was a “search” under the Fourth Amendment, and that a warrant was required. The district court denied that motion and Caira pleaded guilty while reserving his right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion. This is that appeal. Caira also appeals his sentence because the district judge imposed conditions of supervised release without justifying the conditions on the record.","{'Sender': 'DEA', 'Sender Role': 'Law Enforcement', 'Recipient': 'Microsoft Corporation', 'Recipient Role': 'Email Service Provider', 'About': 'gslabs@hotmail.com account', 'About Role': 'User of Email Account', 'Type': 'Subscriber Information, Login Histories (IP Addresses)', 'Purpose': 'DEA Investigation', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'None'}",,,[],Not Applicable

The FBI located a document responsive to the appellant’s inquiry consisting of a one-page interoffice letter and a two-page indices search request. The Bureau withheld this document, however, pursuant to two FOIA exemptions relating to records compiled for law enforcement purposes: Exemption 7(C), which permits an agency to withhold such a document if disclosure could constitute an “unwarranted” invasion of personal privacy, and Exemption 7(D), which permits an agency to withhold such a document if disclosure could reveal the identity of a confidential source. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C), (D). In refusing to release the requested document, the FBI also relied upon Exemption j(2) of the Privacy Act, which allows a law enforcement agency to withhold information compiled in the course of a criminal investigation or for the purpose of enforcing the criminal laws. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(j)(2).When the appellant had exhausted his administrative remedies he filed this action in district court.

Smith perished in the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. Media coverage of the disaster was intensive and extensive; the appellee, New York Times, alone published more than 600 articles on this tragedy and its aftermath. Among these articles was a lengthy account of the continuing effect of the disaster, a year later, on the crew members’ families, describing in detail their grief and their attempts to cope with the loss of their loved ones. See Astronauts’ Families Still Struggle With Grief and Finance, N.Y. Times, Jan. 6, 1987, p. C1, col. 1.Some weeks after the tragedy, NASA was able to locate and recover from the ocean floor a tape recording of voice communications among the Challenger crew and between the crew and ground control before and during the brief flight. The Times asked for a duplicate of the tape. NASA declined that request, but it did provide the Times with a transcript of the tape. In a letter to the Times, NASA claimed that giving the news media a copy of the audio tape itself would subject the astronauts’ families “to hearing the voices of their loved ones, an intrusion on their grief which would certainly exacerbate feelings of hurt and loss.” Unsatisfied, the Times filed suit in the district court, invoking the FOIA.In the district court the Times claimed that “a voice communication tape is essential to fully understand an aircraft accident and to evaluate appropriate corrective measures.” “The tape,” the Times argued, “contains important information which NASA’s transcript — even if it were totally accurate — cannot bring to public light,” including the astronauts’ “voice inflections.” Listening to the tape, the Times contended, will enable the public to verify NASA’s conclusion that “the astronauts had no advance warning of a problem and that the sounds from the engines were not ‘unusual.’ ” It also pointed out that the words spoken on the tape (as revealed in the transcript) contain no personal information about the astronauts or their families. NASA responded that it was the voice inflections, not the words spoken, that it was seeking to withhold because such inflections are personal to the astronauts.","{'Sender': 'The New York Times', 'Sender Role': 'Media', 'Recipient': 'NASA', 'Recipient Role': 'Government Agency', 'About': 'Challenger crew members', 'About Role': 'Astronauts', 'Type': 'Voice recording', 'Purpose': 'FOIA request', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'None'}",,,[],Not Applicable

(Compl. at ¶ 5.) The account became delinquent. (Id.) Plaintiff further alleges that PFCU had knowledge that she had disputed the account. (Id. at ¶ 8.) Plaintiff then alleges, generally, that PFCU proceeded to report the delinquency of the account to consumer credit reporting agencies. (Id. at ¶ 5.)

Count Two); “Reckless and Wanton Conduct” (Compl. & Amend. Compl. Count Three) arising out of the extension of credit, failure to adopt protective policies regarding its communications, and failure to train employees on procedures regarding communication of consumer credit information; “Reckless and Wanton Training and Supervision Related to the FCRA.” (Amend. Compl. Count Six.). Additionally, the alleged acts are the basis of plaintiffs two federal law claims articulated in Count Four and Count Five of the amended complaint, both of which allege violations of the FCRA, § 1681s-2(b).

DePaul subsequently moved to dismiss Slovenic’s complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8(a), 8(e)(1), 10(b), and 12(b)(6). On February 20, 2002, the Court denied DePaul’s motion to dismiss holding that although much of the complaint was unintelligible and contained extraneous matter, the complaint adequately put DePaul “on notice” as required by the Federal Rules.

The match was publicized as “Frazier-Ab/Ali-Frázier IV.” Prior to the match, in March 2001, Defendants showed Ms. Frazier-Lyde a version of Plaintiff Frazier’s image and likeness for use as a poster to promote the match for her approval. Ms. Frazier-Lyde told Defendants that she could not authorize the use of her father’s image and likeness and that they would have to secure such authorization from Plaintiffs. Defendants did not secure such authorization but, instead, sought only to contract with Plaintiff Frazier for his personal appearance at the match. Defendants were advised that Plaintiff Frazier would not be present at the Casino during the June 8, 2001 boxing event in any capacity.Without Defendants’ prior knowledge, Plaintiff Frazier attended the June 8, 2001 event as a member of the audience to support his daughter. During the event, Plaintiff Frazier entered the casino area of the Casino’s main building and saw that his image and likeness had been superimposed on the surface of certain “high roller” gaming tables. The same image and likeness appeared on programs, leaflets, mailings, souvenirs and other party favors that Defendants provided to high rollers and other preferred gambling customers to induce them to attend and to participate in the Casino’s gambling activities during and around the time of the June 8, 2001 boxing event. The unauthorized use and display of Plaintiff Frazier’s image and likeness occurred on a systematic, continuous, and daily basis from about March 1, 2001, through September 30, 2001, as part of Defendants’ marketing and promotion of the June 8, 2001 “Frazier-Ali/Ali-Frazier IV” event.Plaintiff Frazier had not previously been associated with gaming or gambling activities, had never used his name, likeness or image in connection with the advertising and/or promotion of such activities except at a charitable fund raiser, and during the past two years had rejected an overseas on-line business opportunity involving endorsement of commercial gambling because it required the use of his name and likeness in connection with a commercial gambling activity. As “a person of Christian faith” Plaintiff Frazier has suffered extreme emotional damage and compensatory loss because Defendants’ conduct has “irreparably damaged his reputation, distorted the public image he has established for himself, exploited and abused his property rights in himself and his image and offended his personal sensibilities.” See Amended Complaint at ¶ 42.Based upon these facts, Plaintiffs assert that Defendants’ unauthorized use of Plaintiff Frazier’s image and likeness on the gaming tables and on leaflets, programs, mailings and party favors violated §§ 50 and 51 of New York Civil Rights Law and that Defendants undertook the improper use of the image and likeness knowingly, intentionally, maliciously, and solely for Defendants’ exclusive advertising and marketing benefit and for their commercial and financial gain.I","{'Sender': 'Defendants', 'Sender Role': 'Marketers', 'Recipient': 'Ms. Frazier-Lyde', 'Recipient Role': 'Boxer', 'About': 'Plaintiff Frazier', 'About Role': 'Retired Boxer', 'Type': 'Image and Likeness', 'Purpose': 'Marketing and Promotion of Boxing Event', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': ""Defendants' conduct has irreparably damaged Plaintiff Frazier's reputation, distorted the public image he has established for himself, exploited and abused his property rights in himself and his image, and offended his personal sensibilities.""}",,,[],Not Applicable

The trial court consolidated the offenses into one judgment and imposed a sentence in the presumptive range of 192 to 291 months in prison. The trial court also ordered defendant to enroll in lifetime sex offender registration and in lifetime SBM. The evidentiary basis for defendant's plea as presented by the State tended to show the following facts.On 11 November 2015, Anna's mother reported to the New Hanover County Sheriff's Department that Anna had snuck out of the house the night before and was missing. Responding detectives began searching for Anna at her friends' houses. One friend provided Anna's Facebook account and password, and a detective saw some messages between her and another person, later identified as defendant. Anna's friends also reported that they had seen Anna and defendant meet multiple times at a local ice skating rink. That afternoon, an employee at Wave Transit Station in Wilmington called 9-1-1 to report that there were three young people in the area. Responding patrol officers identified two of the people as defendant and Anna, who were then interviewed by the New Hanover County Sheriff's Department.During her interview, Anna reported that after she met defendant, they started communicating online, and she snuck out of her house on the night of 10 November 2015 to be with him. Defendant attempted to rent them a hotel room, but he only had cash, and both hotels only accepted credit cards. She and defendant then had sex in the parking lot and talked about leaving town together, before they were picked up at the bus station. In defendant's interview, he admitted to having sex with Anna and corroborated her version of the events.After the trial court accepted defendant's plea and rendered its sentence on the offenses, the State applied for the imposition of lifetime registration and SBM. Defense counsel objected to both registration and SBM. After the trial court found defendant had committed an aggravating offense under the registration and SBM statutes, it summarily concluded that defendant ""require[s] the highest possible level of supervision and monitoring"" and ordered that he enroll in lifetime registration and be subject to lifetime SBM. Over defendant's objections to the registration and SBM orders, the trial court acknowledged that his guilty plea was contingent upon reserving his right to appeal those orders.

As a result of the evidence supplied by DIRECTV, Inc., Monon brought this action against Defendant Wireman alleging that he purchased these devices to permit viewing of DIRECTV programming, without authorization or payment to Monon. Monon has alleged that Wire-man’s actions, as well as the other Defendants, were in violation of the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. Section 605, and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C.

Monon claims however, that Wireman’s motion for severance should be denied because Monon argues it has properly joined all defendants pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 20.

The next day, the victim discovered that his checkbook was missing and he asked his wife to notify their bank. On October 20, 2009, Rodrigues entered a payday loan establishment to cash one of the checks from the missing checkbook. The check in the amount of $80 was made out to Rodrigues, who told the sales manager that it was payment for babysitting. The sales manager became suspicious, called the telephone number imprinted on the check, and was informed that the check had been stolen. The police were called. The victim denied that the signature on the check was his, informed the police that he did not know Rodrigues, and stated that he had not written the check to Rodrigues.On October 27, 2009, the State filed its Complaint, charging Rodrigues with three counts: (1) Forgery in the Second Degree in violation of HRS § 708-852 (Supp.2009) (Count I); (2) UPCPI (Count II); and (3) Identify Theft 3 (Count III).On December 7, 2009, Rodrigues filed a motion to dismiss Counts II and III on the grounds that she acted in a continuous course of conduct and should be subject to conviction on Count I only because Counts II and III merged with Count I. The State filed a memorandum in opposition, in which the State argued that the three counts do not merge and that, even if they did, the State has a right to prosecute the Defendant for all three counts. At the January 6, 2010 hearing, with respect to Count II, Rodrigues argued that she had not “tried to pass herself off as anyone but herself.” As to Count III, Rodrigues argued that the only document that she had in her possession was the check itself. The State responded that there was no statutory requirement that Rodrigues attempt to assume the identity of another person and that the check constituted “personal information” because it contained the account holder’s name, address, bank routing information, and bank account number. After the hearing, including review of certain stipulated evidence, the Circuit Court concluded that the three counts did not merge, but the factual allegations were insufficient to support the charges in Counts II and III. Accordingly, Counts II and III were dismissed. The State’s motion for reconsideration was denied.

[],Not Applicable,"As apparently is common among mobile home parks, Rancho Santa Barbara rents to mobile home owners the spaces upon which the homes rest. Taylor found and purchased a home to his liking, and then applied for a rental agreement. His application was rejected because of his age. As published in park rules, Rancho Santa Barbara restricts occupancy to persons 55 years old or older, and thus Taylor found that he had 14 years to wait before he could move into his unit.The parties agree that the park’s age rule is permitted by both federal and state statutes. The Federal Housing Act (FHA), as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA) and the Housing for Older Persons Act (HOPA), permits landlords to restrict occupancy to persons 55 years of age or older. See 42 U.S.C. § 3607(b)(2)(C). California’s Mobi-lehome Residency Law (MRL) authorizes management of a mobile home park to limit residence on the basis of age, provided that the age restriction complies with the FHA. See Cal. Civ.Code § 798.76. The MRL operates as an exception to California’s general proscription of age discrimination in housing. See Cal. Civ.Code §§ 51.2, 51.3(c)(4).Taylor argues that the MRL violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause and that the FHA, as amended by HOPA, violates the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, which applies equal protection standards to the federal government. See Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 638, 95 S.Ct. 1225, 43 L.Ed.2d 514 (1975) (holding that the approach to Fifth Amendment equal protection claims is “precisely the same” as under Fourteenth Amendment). The district court held that both statutory schemes survived equal protection challenge as founded upon rational policy decisions by the respective legislative bodies, and granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).We review the correctness of the judgment as a question of law.

[],Not Applicable,"EA is a developer and publisher of video games, including Madden NFL, which EA publishes annually. Madden NFL allows users to play virtual football games between National Football League (NFL) teams by controlling virtual players, or avatars. EA’s graphic artists and programmers create the avatars, as well as virtual stadiums, coaches, referees, fans and other audio and visual elements that allow users to experience a realistic simulation of an NFL game. Users control the movements of the avatars and the outcome of the game through the users’ inputs to the game system.Each annual version of Madden NFL includes all current players for all 32 NFL teams, along with accurate player names, team logos, colors and uniforms. EA has paid National Football Players Inc.—the licensing arm of the National Football League Players Association—annual licensing fees in the millions of dollars to use current players’ likenesses.From 2001 through 2009, Madden NFL also included certain particularly successful or popular “historic teams.” EA did not obtain a license to use the likenesses of the former players on these historic teams. Although the players on the historic teams are not identified by name or photograph, each is described by his position, years in the NFL, height, weight, skin tone and relative skill level in different aspects of the sport. For example, Madden NFL includes as a historic team the 1979 Los Angeles Rams that played in that year’s Super Bowl. Vince Ferragamo, a plaintiff in this action, was a quarterback on the 1979 Rams. He is Caucasian and was listed in the 1979 Rams media guide as a 26 year-old, six-foot three-inch, 207-pound third-year NFL player. Madden NFL depicts an avatar who is a quarterback for the 1979 Rams and has identical physical characteristics. Madden NFL also includes the 1984 Los Angeles Rams, for which Ferragamo was again a quarterback. The 1984 Rams media guide lists Ferragamo as a 30-year-old, six-foot three-inch, 212-pound seventh-year NFL player. Madden NFL depicts an avatar on the 1984 Rams with identical physical characteristics.The plaintiffs alleged that Madden NFL similarly includes, without authorization, accurate likenesses of plaintiffs Michael Davis and Billy Joe Dupree, as well as roughly 6,000 other former NFL players who appear on more than 100 historic teams in various editions of Madden NFL. The plaintiffs asserted claims for right of publicity under California Civil Code § 3344 and California common law, conversion, trespass to chattels and unjust enrichment on behalf of themselves and all former NFL players depicted in Madden NFL. EA moved to strike the complaint as a strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) under California’s anti-SLAPP statute, California Code of Civil Procedure § 425.16.

On September 19, 2011, an agent with the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation used a peer-to-peer program to download one still image from McAbee’s computer. The image showed an adult male engaging in anal intercourse with a prepubescent female. A subsequent search of McAbee’s computer (with a warrant) on November 7, 2011, revealed 203 still images and one video of child pornography in the computer’s “unallocated space.”McAbee was indicted for possession of child pornography (Count 1) and distribution of child pornography (Count 2). See 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(2), (a)(5)(B). He pled guilty to both counts and was sentenced to 65 months imprisonment. Judgment was entered July 26, 2012. Although he did not waive his right to appeal, McAbee did not pursue one. Thus, his conviction became final on August 9, 2012. See United States v. Prows, 448 F.3d 1223, 1227-28 (10th Cir. 2006) (“If the defendant does not file an appeal, the criminal conviction becomes final [for purposes of § 2255(f)(1) ] upon the expiration of the time in which to take a direct criminal appeal.”); Fed.

Pertinent here, he argued counsel was ineffective for failing to discover relevant case law and exculpatory evidence. He blamed the delay in filing his motion on his inexperience with the law. He also argued the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled because he is actually innocent and statutorily tolled under § 2255(f)(4) (newly discovered evidence).The district judge dismissed the motion as untimely because it was not filed within one year from the date his conviction became final. 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(1).

The purchases were made under the supervision of Officer Kronoski and with money supplied by the MPD.The prosecution thereafter applied to the district court for a search warrant. The warrant application was supported by an affidavit from Officer Kronoski recounting the information supplied by the Cl and the details of the three supervised purchases. The application sought a warrant authorizing the search of Gamit’s residence for crystal methamphetamine, United States currency, articles of identification, paraphernalia associated with the use/distribution of crystal methamphetamine, and records relating to the distribution of crystal methamphetamine.At 1:30 p.m. on March 11,1994, the district court issued a search warrant authorizing a search of Gamit’s residence for the items enumerated in the application. The warrant gave authorization to search “within TEN (10) DAYS from the date hereof, but not between the hours of 2:00 o’clock A.M. and 7:00 A.M.”On the day the search warrant issued, at 10:25 p.m., Officer Kronoski searched Gam-it’s residence. The residence contained approximately six bedrooms and there were approximately eight people, including Richardson, in the house at the time the search was conducted. Officer Kronoski searched all of the rooms but found contraband in only two of the rooms.

His probation conditions included the following provision:Defendant shall submit to search and seizure of his/her person, place of residence or area under his/her control, or vehicle, by any probation officer or peace officer, during the day or night, with or without his/her consent, with or without a search warrant, and without regard to probable cause.Law-enforcement officers arrested Ickes when he arrived at a scheduled appointment with his probation officer. Later that day, the officers and Ickes's probation officer conducted a warrantless search of Ickes's residence and vehicle. They obtained evidence, including United States Postal Service labels and tracking information, that was used against Ickes at trial.Ickes moved to suppress the evidence obtained from his residence and vehicle, arguing that the search was unconstitutional. The district court denied Ickes's motion without an evidentiary hearing. Ickes was then convicted by a jury, after which the court sentenced him to 280 months of imprisonment. In this appeal, Ickes argues that (1) the court should have suppressed the evidence obtained from the search, and (2) the court should have held an evidentiary hearing regarding his motion to suppress.","{'Sender': 'United States Postal Inspector, Law-Enforcement Officers', 'Sender Role': 'Law Enforcement', 'Recipient': ""Ickes, Ickes's Probation Officer"", 'Recipient Role': 'Defendant, Probation Officer', 'About': 'Ickes', 'About Role': 'Defendant', 'Type': 'Private information related to drug trafficking, United States Postal Service labels and tracking information', 'Purpose': 'Law enforcement investigation, probation compliance check', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'Probable cause to believe that the package contained drugs, violation of probation conditions'}",,,[],Not Applicable

Officer Joseph Lavis testified for the government at the suppression hearing. He stated that every officer on the night shift responded to the call. Upon arrival, Officer Lavis noticed many youths fleeing the scene. There was also an adult male passed out across the street from the residences. Officer Lavis testified that he noticed a small boy, Derek Barkovitz, standing at the porch of the 979 LeBlane residence. Officer Lavis and three other officers approached the youth. According to Lavis he asked the boy, who he recognized as a resident of the home, “Who had a gun?” or “Where is the gun?” • or something to that effect.According to Officer Lavis, Derek Barko-vitz, without a word spoken, walked him and all the officers to his father’s bedroom, where Derek lifted the corner of a waterbed mattress to display a handgun. Officer Lavis immediately secured the unloaded weapon.When the boy’s father, Michael Barkovitz, Sr., who was later identified as the man unconscious across the street, came to, he was charged as a felon in possession of a firearm.The government argues that the warrant-less search was valid because young Derek Barkovitz consented to the search of the home and his father’s bedroom.The versions given by the police do not support a finding of consent. The issue is whether Derek legally granted consent where he was without any knowledge of the significance of such an act, or without any understanding, explicit or implied, of his legal right to disallow the officers entry.","{'Sender': 'Lincoln Park Police', 'Sender Role': 'Law Enforcement', 'Recipient': 'Michael Barkovitz Sr. ', 'Recipient Role': 'Homeowner', 'About': 'Derek Barkovitz', 'About Role': 'Minor child and resident of the home', 'Type': 'Private information about the consent to search ', 'Purpose': 'Law enforcement investigation ', 'In Reply To': 'None ', 'Consented By': 'Derek Barkovitz ', 'Belief': 'None'}",,,[],Not Applicable

According to the criminal complaint and the testimony at trial, the police decided to conduct a controlled buy using an undercover police officer after receiving a complaint of drug dealing at a particular address in Milwaukee. The undercover officer went to the address with $60.00 of marked money. Upon reaching the front door of the residence, the undercover officer was directed to go to the back door by Phillips. Once there, he was met by Phillips who invited him into the kitchen where the officer purchased cocaine from Phillips and gave Phillips the recorded money. The officer left the house and proceeded to a car parked nearby where other police officers were waiting. The lead detective then decided to initiate a knock and talk and began walking to the back door with two police officers when they spotted Phillips standing in the doorway. Phillips, upon seeing the police officers, began retreating into his home, at which point the officers then began running to the door while yelling, ""Police, stop."" Phillips did not stop, and instead, he shut the door and ran up the stairs. The police pursued Phillips by kicking in the door. Phillips was arrested inside and contraband was found in the house. The undercover officer identified Phillips from a photo array, and Phillips was charged with one count of delivery of a controlled substance — cocaine.¶ 4. Prior to the jury trial, the State filed an amended information charging Phillips with two additional charges: possession of a controlled substance —tetrahydrocannabinols (marijuana), second or subsequent offense, and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance — cocaine (more than one gram but less than five grams). Phillips filed a motion to suppress alleging that because the police manufactured their own exigent circumstances by deciding to conduct a knock and talk rather than obtaining a search warrant, the pursuit of Phillips into his house was illegal, and therefore, the drugs found in the home had to be suppressed. The trial court denied the motion.¶ 5. Phillips was convicted of all three counts. On the charge of delivery of a controlled substance— cocaine (one gram or less), he was sentenced to two years of imprisonment to be followed by two years of extended supervision; on the charge of possession of a controlled substance — tetrahydrocannabinols (marijuana), second or subsequent offense, he was given a sentence of one year in the House of Correction; and on the charge of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance — cocaine (more than one gram but less than five grams), he was sentenced to three years of imprisonment to be followed by three years of extended supervision. All of the sentences were to be served concurrent to one another but consecutive to any other sentence. Phillips brought a postconviction motion seeking to have the convictions vacated and alleging that he received the ineffective assistance of trial counsel. This motion was denied without a hearing.

[],Not Applicable,"On a late November morning in 2003, Chicago police officers responded to a report of domestic abuse at the home of Patricia and Kevin Henderson on the southwest side of the city. At the scene officers found Patricia standing with a neighbor on the front lawn of her home. She told the officers that Henderson had choked her and then threw her out of the house after learning she had called 911. Patricia had noticeable red marks around her neck that substantiated her story.The Hendersons’ teenage son arrived shortly after the police and gave them a key to the home. Before the police entered, Patricia told them that Henderson had weapons in the house and had a history of drug and gun arrests. Patricia said she was willing to file a complaint against Henderson and wanted him arrested. The parties dispute whether or not Patricia also told the officers, prior to their entering the house, that she wanted the house searched.The police used the key to enter the house and found Henderson in the living room. After a brief exchange, Henderson told the officers to “[g]et the [expletive] out of my house” — which the district court reasonably construed as an objection to a search. Henderson was then arrested for domestic battery and taken to the police station. Patricia was still outside and did not observe Henderson’s encounter with the police. A few minutes after Henderson was taken to the station, Patricia agreed to a search of the home and signed a consent form.Patricia led the officers to the attic where they discovered crack cocaine and drug-dealing paraphernalia, four handguns, a shotgun, a rifle, a machine gun, and live rounds of ammunition. In the basement they found a machete, a crossbow, and more ammunition, as well as an M-1000 explosive device. Patricia suggested that the officers also search the family car, and she signed another consent form. This search uncovered additional crack cocaine.Henderson was charged with possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), various firearms-related offenses in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922 and 924, and possession of an explosive device in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d). Henderson moved to suppress the evidence obtained from the search of the house and car, arguing that the Supreme Court’s decision in Randolph required suppression because he was a present and objecting resident whose express refusal to allow a search overrode Patricia’s later consent. The district court agreed as to the search of the house and suppressed the evidence recovered in that search.

Smith perished in the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. Media coverage of the disaster was intensive and extensive; the appellee, New York Times, alone published more than 600 articles on this tragedy and its aftermath. Among these articles was a lengthy account of the continuing effect of the disaster, a year later, on the crew members’ families, describing in detail their grief and their attempts to cope with the loss of their loved ones. See Astronauts’ Families Still Struggle With Grief and Finance, N.Y. Times, Jan. 6, 1987, p. Cl, col. 1.Some weeks after the tragedy, NASA was able to locate and recover from the ocean floor a tape recording of voice communications among the Challenger crew and between the crew and ground control before and during the brief flight. The Times asked for a duplicate of the tape. NASA declined that request, but it did provide the Times with a transcript of the tape. In a letter to the Times, NASA claimed that giving the news media a copy of the audio tape itself would subject the astronauts’ families “to hearing the voices of their loved ones, an intrusion on their grief which would certainly exacerbate feelings of hurt and loss.” Unsatisfied, the Times filed suit in the district court, invoking the FOIA.In the district court the Times claimed that “a voice communication tape is essential to fully understand an aircraft accident and to evaluate appropriate corrective measures.” “The tape,” the Times argued, “contains important information which NASA’s transcript — even if it were totally accurate — cannot bring to public light,” including the astronauts’ “voice inflections.” Listening to the tape, the Times contended, will enable the public to verify NASA’s conclusion that “the astronauts had no advance warning of a problem and that the sounds from the engines were not ‘unusual.’ ” It also pointed out that the words spoken on the tape (as revealed in the transcript) contain no personal information about the astronauts or their families. NASA responded that it was the voice inflections, not the words spoken, that it was seeking to withhold because such inflections are personal to the astronauts.","{'Sender': 'The New York Times', 'Sender Role': 'News media', 'Recipient': 'NASA', 'Recipient Role': 'Government agency', 'About': 'Challenger crew voice communication tape', 'About Role': 'Recorded voices of the Challenger crew', 'Type': 'Voice recording', 'Purpose': 'To obtain a copy of the tape for news reporting', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'None'}",,,[],Not Applicable

The indictment charges all Defendants as part of a conspiracy to commit drug-related offenses and charges them with the underlying substantive offenses of the conspiracy, which include two counts of possession with the intent to distribute marijuana, three counts of possession with the intent to distribute methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), and two counts of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.Bushay filed the motions currently before the Court seeking to suppress the seizure of a firearm from a hotel room in Tampa, Florida; his statements made to police following his arrest in Florida; evidence gained through the searches of two residences in Georgia; and evidence gained through a traffic stop.

Each complaint numbers 43 paragraphs and, with the exception of paragraph nine, are identically worded. In each case, paragraph nine contains specific, defendant-related account numbers and alleges that plaintiff began to dispute allegedly erroneous credit reports with Equifax Information Services, Inc., and/or Experian Information Solutions, Inc., Trans Union, LLC, and its affiliate bureau, Gulf Coast Credit Services beginning in January 2000. (See Complaints, ¶ 9, respectively.) Otherwise, the complaints all allege that the credit reporting agencies notified the defendants of the disputed claims, that the agencies requested the defendants re-investigate the disputed claims, and that the defendants failed or refused to investigate and continued to report inaccurate information. (Complaints, ¶¶ 11-14.) The plaintiff alleges that GMAC willfully or negligently violated the mandates of 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2(b). (Docs. 1 and 13, ¶¶ 14-17). The plaintiff further alleges that GMAC “likewise violated the mandates of section 1681s-2(a) and such violations form the basis of a negligence per se claim and an intentional tort, per se.” (Id., at ¶ 17.)

A Rule 12(b)(6) motion questions the legal sufficiency of a complaint. In assessing the merits of Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court must assume that all the factual allegations set forth in the complaint are true. See, e.g. United States v.

During the search, the defendant was presented with a “Search Warrant Notice of Service” (“Notice of Service”). The Notice of Service did not indicate which items the officers and agents were authorized to seize, or state the address of the premises to be searched. The government acknowledged during oral argument that the “Notice of Service” is not a warrant. After the defendant was booked, he apparently received a property receipt indicating what items the officers had seized. The government conceded during oral argument that at no time before, during, or immediately after the search, did it serve a search warrant on the defendant. It appears that the defendant was first provided with the search warrant as part of the government’s discovery obligations.In his motion to suppress evidence, the defendant argued that the Notice of Service was inadequate under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(f) (“Rule 41”) and the Fourth Amendment. The argument regarding Rule 41 was premised on the contention that the investigation had been “federal in character.” On October 18, 2004, after determining that the investigation had not been federal in character and that Rule 41 did not apply, the Court denied the defendant’s motion to suppress. The Court granted the defendant'leave to submit supplemental briefing, which was filed with the Court on October 22, 2004.On November 1, 2004, the defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of order denying motion to suppress evidence. The Court denied this motion on December 1, 2004.On December 21, 2004, a jury convicted the defendant on all three counts of the indictment.On December 27, 2004, the defendant filed his second motion for reconsideration of order denying motion to suppress evidence, which is now before the Court. The argument contained in the defendant’s reply brief relies on a recent Ninth Circuit case, United States v.
